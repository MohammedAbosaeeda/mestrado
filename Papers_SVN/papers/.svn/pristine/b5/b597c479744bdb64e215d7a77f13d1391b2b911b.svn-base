\section{Conclusion} \label{concl}

Energy constraints drives the whole process of designing wireless sensor network systems.
Although the use of solar energy harvesting techniques in the field have emerged along last years, only a few of them were designed for recent low power wireless platforms.
Therefore, this work presented a reformulation of a solar energy harvesting circuit in order to supply energy to those platforms efficiently.
Tests were carried outdoor in order to evaluate the proposed energy harvesting circuit.
This circuit also allowed accurate and frequent battery charge measurements to be provided to an energy-aware task scheduler.
Simulations have shown that 1.23 times more non-critical tasks were executed deploying the new harvesting circuit.
Finally, the tests allowed an experimental correlation between the solar panel's current and the solar irradiance.
On-going work is relying on this correlation to include heuristics to the energy-scheduler that may take environmental predictions into account.
