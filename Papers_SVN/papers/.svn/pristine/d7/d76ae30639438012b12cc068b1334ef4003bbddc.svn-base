- We describe an AOP-based method for designing synthesizable hardware components using SystemC;
- Our mechanisms are based only on standard C++ features available on the SystemC synthesizable subset;
- No external aspect weaving tool is required;
- In a PABX case study, we have increased the code reuse by about 33% with a circuit area overhead of only 2%.
