Dear Dr. Antônio Augusto Fröhlich,

The paper "Software Application Design Based on Architecture,
Reliability and Cost" has been submitted to The Ninth IEEE Symposium on
Computers and Communications.  It has the following abstract:

In this paper we present an optimization framework based on an
evolutionary algorithm to design a modular software application taking
into account its architecture, reliability and cost. The specific design
problem that we address is the reliability maximization of a software
application subject to a specified cost constraint. Evolutionary
algorithm (EA) is used as an optimization technique because of the
discontinuous search space, usually nonlinear but monotonic relation
between cost and reliability of individual modules comprising the
software application and complex software architectures giving rise to
nonlinear dependencies between individual module reliabilities and the
overall application reliability. We demonstrate how the EA can be
effectively and efficiently to design a software application using three
case studies.

We believe that this paper falls within your area of expertise and would
appreciate if you could review the paper. If you agree to review the
paper by the deadline January 30, 2004, please click on the URL below:

http://edas.info/Ry.cgi?r=92845&user=105728

You will receive detailed review instructions by email.

The paper review is requested by Antonio Puliafito.

The review is due by January 30, 2004.  It is very important that both

Dear Dr. Antônio Augusto Fröhlich,

The paper "Software Application Design Based on Architecture,
Reliability and Cost" has been submitted to The Ninth IEEE Symposium on
Computers and Communications.  It has the following abstract:

In this paper we present an optimization framework based on an
evolutionary algorithm to design a modular software application taking
into account its architecture, reliability and cost. The specific design
problem that we address is the reliability maximization of a software
application subject to a specified cost constraint. Evolutionary
algorithm (EA) is used as an optimization technique because of the
discontinuous search space, usually nonlinear but monotonic relation
between cost and reliability of individual modules comprising the
software application and complex software architectures giving rise to
nonlinear dependencies between individual module reliabilities and the
overall application reliability. We demonstrate how the EA can be
effectively and efficiently to design a software application using three
case studies.

*** 1. Detailed Comments: The paper is well written, but the proposed
strategy for IP address lookup is rather simple. The idea of narrowing
the search group by deploying hierarchical data structures is as old as
computer science. The data structures used are also straightforward.
Nevertheless, I have to admit that you approached the subject
comprehensively and pointed out results that, although easily
predictable, confirm your proposal.  In my opinion, the text fits better
a industry technical report than a conference paper.

*** 2.Confidential Comments for Committee: The paper is well organized
and written, the ideas are explained in full and also clearly referenced
and evaluated, but the proposed strategy for IP address lookup is rather
simple. In my opinion, the text fits better a industry technical report
than a conference paper.

Dear Dr. Antônio Augusto Fröhlich:

On behalf of the Technical Program Committee, we regret to inform you
that your paper #1568926733 ('On Component Frameworks for Embedded
Systems') cannot be included in the technical program. As the conference
received a large number of papers this year, a significant number of
high-quality papers could not be accommodated.

adapting the operating system to the requirements of the application,
rather than the traditional approach of adapting the application to what
is offered by the operating system. A component framework where
operating system services could be built by customizing reusable
components is presented.

While the description of the component framework is definitely
interesting, the usefulness of the framework should be backed up with a
case study.

and for the authors.): ------Brief description : The main point of the
paper is  to present a strategy for developing component frameworks that
could be used to instantiate specific operating systems for embedded
applications.

The problem is well identified in Introduction  when a programmer has to
develop  an embedded application, he must, at most, to select certain
characteristics of operating systems, for instance device drivers. He
rarely has the chance of choosing an infrastructure of objects which
provides an adequate runtime environment , with minimum overhead for the
application.

Hence, the possible solution is to build the operating system  as an
aggregate of reusable software components that can be chosen so as to be
an adequate infrastructure to certain embedded applications. The
components are chosen regarding the application  requirements. A
framework of components that provides the components and their
relationships could be useful for that purpose, such a framework  is the
result reported in the paper

--------- Comments :

- At the end of the Introduction section, a paragraph showing the
outline of the paper should be written.

- The paper lacks a section presenting related works, specially
regarding frameworks. One of the most important authors is Fayad.
FAYAD,M.E.; SCHMIDT, D.C.  Object-oriented application frameworks.
Communic. Of the ACM. V.40, n.10, 1997 FAYAD,M.E.; SCHMIDT, D.C.;
JOHNSON.R.   Building application frameworks: Object-oriented
foundations of framework design  John Wiley & Sons, 1999.

- I suppose because of the lack of the related works, certain well 
known terms are presented in paper in other words  such as, on page 1,
´configurable features´ are usually named as ´hot spots´ of frameworks.
Besides the classical references, it should be very interesting to
mention more recent works related to component frameworks, although we
know there is no  consensus yet.

- Another consequence of the lack of related works is the impossibility
of the proposed idea being compared to other approaches. The comparison
would be interesting to situate in the context of the other researches
and to show the contributions. In the current paper, the readers cannot
see the relevance or the actual contribution of the proposed idea.

- In the Abstract and the Conclusion sections, the author says that the
main contribution is the strategy of developing component frameworks ,
BUT the strategy is distributed throughout the paper and it should be
presented in a more formal way. After the strategy has be described in
the sections Domain Engineering and Component Frameworks, we can see a
case study which had lead the author to develop the strategy. The
readers expect the strategy be well defined, maybe by means of its
steps, activities and intermediate artifacts.

- The Figure 2 shows schematically the framework , but it is not clear
what is a component and a family (concepts that have being used since
the beginning of the paper).

- The strategy has two phases, basically: identifying families of
scenario-independent abstractions, and identifying scenario aspects.
Although concepts of Aspects-oriented Programming are mentioned,
scenario aspects are loosely presented; it would be interesting to show
how the concepts of Aspects-oriented Programming are applied and which
Programming language was adopted. Figure 3 could be used to explain the
scenario aspects in mode detail.

- At the final part of section 2, the term ´application-oriented system
design´ is used. However, the process of developing a framework starts
with Domain Engineering , trying to identify usual abstractions in a
domain and the idea is not to identify specific abstractions of
applicationsFinally, a better term could be ´ domain-oriented system
design´ , couldnt?

attend the conference and contribute to stimulating discussions around
an exciting technical program in a unique environment.
