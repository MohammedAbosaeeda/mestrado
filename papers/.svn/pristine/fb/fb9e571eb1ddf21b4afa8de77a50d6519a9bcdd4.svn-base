\Note{Legend:}{T: task;
P: period in $ms$;
WCET: worst-case execution time in $ms$;
WCEC: worst-case energy consumption in $\eta Ah$;
25-days: energy consumption for the targeted lifetime (25 days) in $mAh$.}

\Note{Route:}{The ``Route'' task is a sporadic task.
Once it is a best-effort task, we consider a hypothetic frequency of $2$ Hz (period of 500 $ms$) to show the impact of routing in energy consumption.}
