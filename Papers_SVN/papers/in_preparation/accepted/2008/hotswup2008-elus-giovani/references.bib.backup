  ABSTRACT = {Wireless sensor networks are composed of large
                  numbers of tiny networked devices that communicate
                  untethered. For large scale networks it is important
                  to be able to dynamically download code into the
                  network. In this paper we present Contiki, a
                  lightweight operating system with support for
                  dynamic loading and replacement of individual
                  programs and services. Contiki is built around an
                  event-driven kernel but provides optional preemptive
                  multithreading that can be applied to individual
                  processes. We show that dynamic loading and
                  unloading is feasible in a resource constrained
                  environment, while keeping the base system
                  lightweight and compact.},
