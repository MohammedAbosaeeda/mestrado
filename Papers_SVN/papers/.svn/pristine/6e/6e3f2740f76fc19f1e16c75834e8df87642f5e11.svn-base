This paper presented EA-ADHOP: an energy-efficient version of the ADHOP routing protocol for wireless sensor networks.
As ADHOP, EA-ADHOP uses ant-colony optimization techniques to homogenize energy consumption among network links.
The energy-aware approach employs energy-related heuristic metrics to balance the functions defining the deposit and evaporation rates of pheromone in the network links.
The modeling and behavior of the routing algorithm is explained, as are the mechanisms to obtain the energy-related metrics.

Results show that EA-ADHOP enabled the system to sustain a prolonged lifetime and raised packet delivery rate.
As a consequence, the resulting system is more energy-efficient as it spends less energy per delivered packet when compared to others.
The main for the performance enhancement is that the balanced network load promoted by the routing mechanism lessen the amount of failures due to complete battery depletions.
This builds a better network connectivity.
