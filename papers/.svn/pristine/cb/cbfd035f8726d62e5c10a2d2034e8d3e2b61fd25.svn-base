                  discipline with new technologies emerging, new
                  applications being developed and standards being
                  finalized. Sensors and actuators allow for entirely
                  new kinds of distributed embedded systems. Wireless
                  nodes attached to circuits or appliances form a
                  dynamic, multi-hop routing network that connects each
                  node to more powerful networks and processing
                  resources. The applications are becoming an important
                  part of everyday life as well as having a crucial role
                  to play in industrial and military situations. In
                  Wireless Sensor Network Designs Anna Ha? explains
                  everything you need to know about sensor technologies,
                  design issues, protocols, and accepted solutions for
                  wireless sensor network architectures. "

                  communication devices and sensors makes a rich design
                  space of networked sensors viable. They can be deeply
                  embedded in the physical world and spread throughout
                  our environment like smart dust. The missing elements
                  are an overall system architecture and a methodology
                  for systematic advance. To this end, we identify key
                  requirements, develop a small device that is
                  representative of the class, design a tiny
                  event-driven operating system, and show that it
                  provides support for e cient modularity and
                  concurrency-intensive operation. Our operating system
                  ts in 178 bytes of memory, propagates events in the
                  time it takes to copy 1.25 bytes of memory, context
                  switches in the time it takes to copy 6 bytes of
                  memory and supports two level scheduling. The analysis
                  lays a groundwork for future architectural advances."

  abstract =	 "Modern high-speed local area net-works offer great
                  potential for communication- intensive applications,
                  but their performance is limited by the use of
                  traditional communication protocols, such as
                  TCP/IP. In most cases, these protocols require that
                  all network access be through the operating system,
                  which adds significant overhead to both the
                  transmission path (typically a system call and data
                  copy) and the receive path (typically an interrupt, a
                  system call, and a data copy). To address this
                  performance problem, several user-level communication
                  architectures have been developed that remove the
                  operating system from the critical communication
                  path. This article describes six important issues to
                  consider in designing communication protocols for
                  user-level architectures. The issues discussed focus
                  on the performance and semantics of a communication
                  system. These issues include data transfer, address
                  translation, protection, and control transfer
                  mechanisms, as well as the issues of reliability and
                  multicast. To provide a basis for analyzing these
                  issues, the authors present a simple network interface
                  protocol for Myricom's Myrinet network, which has a
                  programmable network interface. Researchers can thus
                  explore many protocol design options, and several
                  groups have designed communication systems for
                  Myrinet. In this article, the authors refer to 11 such
                  systems, all of which differ significantly in how they
                  resolve these design issues but all of which aim for
                  high performance and provide a lean, low-level, and
                  more or less generic communication facility."

   "Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a group of mobile nodes which communicates
    with each other without any supporting infrastructure. Routing in
    MANET is extremely challenging because of MANETs dynamic features,
    its limited bandwidth and power energy. Nature-inspired algorithms
    (swarm intelligence) such as ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms
    have shown to be a good technique for developing routing algorithms
    for MANETs. Swarm intelligence is a computational intelligence technique
    that involves collective behavior of autonomous agents that locally
    interact with each other in a distributed environment to solve a
    given problem in the hope of finding a global solution to the problem.
    In this paper, we propose a hybrid routing algorithm for MANETs based
    on ACO and zone routing framework of bordercasting. The algorithm,
    HOPNET, based on ants hopping from one zone to the next, consists
    of the local proactive route discovery within a node's neighborhood
    and reactive communication between the neighborhoods. The algorithm
    has features extracted from ZRP and DSR protocols and is simulated
    on GlomoSim and is compared to AODV routing protocol. The algorithm
    is also compared to the well known hybrid routing algorithm, AntHocNet,
    which is not based on zone routing framework. Results indicate that
    HOPNET is highly scalable for large networks compared to AntHocNet.
    The results also indicate that the selection of the zone radius has
    considerable impact on the delivery packet ratio and HOPNET performs
    significantly better than AntHocNet for high and low mobility. The
    algorithm has been compared to random way point model and random
    drunken model and the results show the efficiency and inefficiency
    of bordercasting. Finally, HOPNET is compared to ZRP and the strength
    of nature-inspired algorithm is shown.",
