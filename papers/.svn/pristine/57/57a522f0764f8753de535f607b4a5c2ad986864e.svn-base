                  overdue CSE curricular upgrades. Because of the impact
                  of reconfigurable computing, configware engineering
                  has proceeded from niche to mainstream. Morphware has
                  become an essential and indispensable ingredient in
                  SoC (System on a Chip) design and beyond. It turns
                  embedded system design from hardware / software
                  co-design into configware / software co-design [1] [2]
                  [3] [4]. This hot development, supported by the
                  fastest growing segment of the semiconductor market
                  [5], provides morphware [6] [7] as an alternative
                  RAM-based 'programmable' (more precisely called:
                  'reconfigurable') platform for parallelism avoiding
                  the limitations of classical high performance
                  computation [8] [9] [10] caused by the von Neumann
                  paradigm [11] [12] [13]. The digital divide of
                  computing determines who is qualified to take off
                  toward new horizons in high performance computing,
                  and, who is not. Currently the typical CS graduate is
                  not."

                  processor architecture description. Its main goal is
                  to provide enough information, at the right level of
                  abstraction, in order to allow users to explore and
                  verify new architectures, by automatically generating
                  software tools like simulators and co-verification
                  interfaces. ArchC\u2019s key features are a
                  storage-based co-verification mechanism that
                  automatically checks the consistency of a refined
                  ArchC model against a reference (functional)
                  description, memory hierarchy modeling capability, the
                  possibility of integration with other SystemC IPs and
                  the automatic generation of high-level SystemC
                  simulators and assemblers. We have used ArchC to
                  synthesize both functional and cycle-based simulators
                  for the MIPS and Intel 8051 processors, as well as
                  functional models of architectures like SPARC V8,

  ABSTRACT = {The Oxygen project is based on the premise that computation will eventually become as freely available as air. To achieve this goal, however, computer scientists, software designers and electrical engineers must rethink the basic architecture that underlies current computer systems. My colleagues and I in the Raw project at the M. I.T. Laboratory for Computer Science are developing an entirely new kind of microprocessor for the Oxygen project. Called the Raw chip, it will deliver unprecedented performance, energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness because of its flexible design: by exposing its wiring to the software system, the chip itself can be customized to suit the needs of whatever application is running on it. }
