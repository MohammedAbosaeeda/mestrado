COMMENTS TO AUTHOR:  (Please use additional sheet(s) if necessary)

Overall, this is a good preliminary paper.  However, there are many
grammar mistakes that distract from the points you are trying to make.

Some comments/questions:

  - a better example (with a little more detail) of how target users
    use your tools would be helpful

  - you specify a methodology and give an example of how your system
    works ... but it is unclear how beneficial or compelling it would
    be to end users (e.g., "inflated interfaces" seems to suggest
    that programmers will need to learn a large number of complicated
    APIs in order to use your system)

  - it appears the generated runtimes are statically determined and
    built; can the runtime system adapt to faster communication
    channels or topologies? (i.e., how flexible is the generated
    runtime system to further optimizations?)

COMMENTS TO AUTHOR:  (Please use additional sheet(s) if necessary)

This paper provides an interesting introduction to ambitious work 
needed to aid in the construction of portable, parallel software.
Though the work is not complete, it presents useful ideas
on multi-platform parallel programming, and is worthy of
publication.

Much of the English grammar is "rough" and needs to be improved.

It isn't too difficult to follow the "flow" of the paper, but
it definitely needs proof-reading and revision.

The EPOS project is mentioned over and over again, but not once
(that I could see), is the acronym spelled out. 

Overall, I think the theme of this paper is valuable, and that
it will make a great contribution to the Proceedings once
the paper is proof-read and revised.

COMMENTS TO AUTHOR:  (Please use additional sheet(s) if necessary)

This paper applies the "Application-Oriented System Design" to provide
communication systems tailored to application communication abstractions
(like mailbox or asynchronous method invocation) and tailored to the
available network cards. 

The paper seems interesting but it does not contains any evidence of
its claims.

The introduction states the problem but the most important assumption
(that there is no best solution) is only claim without any indication
of the reasons (only a reference to a book of 1994). 

Section 2 :

a. an 'n' is missing in the word design (reference 9)

Section 3 : 

a. If I am correct, the goal of presenting an full interface to
   the programmer is to allow him to used all operations whatever
   the real network is. The problem is that syntactical or semantic
   analysis of the code have to be perform to found what abstraction
   is used. Why do not let the programmer specify what interfaces
   he wants to used ? All good programmer should know that. So,
   always provide an inflate interface but with some configuration
   capabilities. That way, complex semantic analysis of the code
   are avoided.

Section 4: 

a. It should have been interesting to know the kind of machine is used.

b. The assumption that communication systems like FM, PM and 
   BIP make copies is wrong : most of the times, they do *NOT* makes
   any copies thanks to buffer shared between the kernel and the user
   space. Exception may arise for short messages as copy let to better
   performances that DMA.

c. The performance figured reported on the paper are not the best
   reported for PC interconnect by myrinet board : BIP achieved
   126.13 Mo/s on top of Linux.
   (cf http://lhpca.univ-lyon1.fr/Resultats/perfs.html)

d. What is the overhead of your system ? According to the approach
   presented, it should be small : so present the raw performances
   to validate the approach.

In conclusion, the paper presents an interesting approach but some
more work is needed. In all case, the paper should not be published
without fixing the errors in section 4.

COMMENTS TO AUTHOR:  (Please use additional sheet(s) if necessary)

The paper proposes a framework to develop application-oriented communication
system. The proposed framework approach is interesting and can deliver a wide 
range of applications with the communication services they need.
The paper needs to elaborate more on the attributes and the mechanisms that
must be implemented to accommodate application requirements; for example what 
type of multi-cast algorithms, type of flow or error control,etc.
