\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\emph{Wireless Sensor Networks} (WSNs) are enabling a myriad of novel \emph{Information Technologies} and \emph{Communication Applications}.
Our future \emph{Smart Cities} and \emph{Internet of Things} will also rely on technologies being developed in the realm of WSNs.
It is now evident that planet Earth will soon be instrumented by billions or trillions of micro and nanosensors---hopefully biodegradable.
For such a large scale deployment, application designers must consider a large number of failures, which will cause the network's topology to change constantly.
Many applications will also require nodes to go mobile, either embedded in some ordinary device or specifically designed to move around, such as floating sensors on a lake.
This class of WSN applications calls for routing algorithms able to deal with dynamic topologies and their resulting overhead.

Many routing concepts for networks have been developed, mainly for \emph{Mobile Ad Hoc Networks} (MANETs) [].
Protocols for mobile networks must be self-organizing and self-configuring to deal efficiently with dynamic topologies.
However, most of these solutions relies in mechanisms that generate additional overhead to manage mobility.
As a result, few of them can go with the low-resource and high-noise world of WSNs.

Among the routing algorithms for MANETs, ant-based algorithms have been effective to deal with mobility-related overhead~[].
Based on the \emph{Ant Colony Optimization} (ACO) metaheuristic, such algorithms employ pheromone as a metric to define the quality of routes.
The goal of this method is to abstract routing operations into simpler operations of pheromone's deposit and evaporation.
Many approaches based on ACO have been specifically designed for WSNs, due to such simplicity~[].

In this paper, we explore ACO-based routing techniques to design a routing algorithm which aims at reducing the routing overhead in mobile WSN environments.
We describe \emph{Ant-based Dynamic Hop Optimization Protocol} (ADHOP), a self-organizing and self-configuring routing algorithm for mobile networks~[].
We compare it with the HOPNET, a routing protocol for MANETs that aims at handling mobility efficiently~[].
We show in such comparison how to encompass many optimization criteria under the pheromone concept, thus allowing for a slim, yet configurable, implementation of a routing algorithm.
We also compare ADHOP with the most significant related ones by means of a simulation performed with OMNeT++, using a high mobility scenario for IEEE 802.15.4 networks.
We show how such optimizations help to achieve better results in terms of data delivery ratio and routing overhead.
Besides corroborating our claims, this evaluation sets guidelines that can be used by other researches while designing WSN routing algorithms.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

WSNs are noisy and error prone; therefore, efficient routing techniques must deal with the communication limitations to achieve the application purpose.
In mobile environments, the associated routing protocol must also be aware of the nodes' mobility to avoid additional overhead.

The main problem for such networks is the breakage and regeneration of links at the routing layer as they consist of mobile nodes.
\emph{Optimized Link State Routing Protocol} (OLSR) is a proactive link state routing protocol for wireless ad hoc networks~[].
The protocol sends topology control messages intermittently to discover and then disseminate link state information throughout the network.
Each node uses this topology information to compute the next hop.

\emph{Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector} (DSDV) is also a proactive routing protocol which guarantees loop-free routes~[].
DSDV models cooperative nodes that periodically announces the interconnection topology among nodes to provide appropriate connectivity for mobile nodes in ad hoc networks.
Nevertheless, in mobile networks, due to constant changes in topology, proactive routing algorithms is not feasible.
The cost to maintain updated routes in mobile and ad hoc networks is still extremely high, mainly for WSNs.

\emph{Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector} (AODV) is a reactive routing protocol designed for MANETs~[].
The protocol defines routes using a route request and route reply query cycle.
Considering high mobility and high rate of data loss, AODV may increase the load of control packets.
Each time a route breaks, AODV floods the network with these messages to notify and/or define a new route.
\emph{Dynamic On-demand MANET routing protocol} (DYMO) is also a reactive routing for MANETs~[].
This protocol is similar to AODV, but it uses more basic route discovery and maintenance procedures.
However, DYMO presents the same overhead of AODV in regard to highly dynamic topologies.

Haas [] proposed \emph{Zone Routing Protocol} (ZRP), a hybrid routing protocol that aims at reducing the control overhead of proactive protocols and the latency of reactive protocols.
Each node maintains a proactive routing within its zone in order to obtain reliable link information among its neighbors.
The reactive routing handles the packets to outside the zone.
HOPNET is a multihop hybrid routing algorithm proposed by Thulasiram and others [].
This protocol has features extracted from ZRP and involves ACO in the proactive routing in order to maintain and improve the existing routes or explore better options.
HOPNET has obtained satisfactory results in environments of high scalability and high mobility.
Because of its efficiency in dealing with dynamic topology networks, many HOPNET features influence the ADHOP algorithm.

Data-centric routing protocols tend to be a favorable choice to reduce the transmitted redundant data due to the ability to select a set of sensor nodes during the relaying of information.
\emph{Adaptive Ant Colony System} (AACS) is a data-centric routing protocol which uses \emph{Direct Diffusion} to distribute interest messages to construct the \emph{Minimum Steiner Tree} (MST) [].
Data aggregation based on AACS, along with the MST, helps to reduce the amount of transmitted data in the network to save energy and prolong network lifetime.
In dynamic topologies, the algorithm needs to reconstruct the MST periodically causing additional overhead and thus compromising both targeted metrics.
Differently from ADHOP, most of this class of protocols does not consider dynamic topologies, hindering an efficient data flow in the network.

\emph{Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy} (LEACH) is a hierarchical and cluster-based algorithm which minimizes energy consumption by distributing the network load at different points in time [].
LEACH performs local computation in each cluster to reduce the amount of data that must be transmitted to the base station.
Nonetheless, it relies on single-hop communication to the cluster-head and the sink.
In dynamic topologies, it brings extra overhead to the cluster-head and diminish the gain in energy consumption.

\emph{Energy Efficient Variable Area Routing} protocol (EE-VAR) is a cluster formation algorithm that aims at improving energy efficiency [].
These clustering methods of sensor networks tend to reduce the network load.
The proposed method minimizes energy consumption by prolonging a setup period and thus reducing to the least possible number the amount of nodes participating in setup.
However, EE-VAR still presents the same limitations of LEACH in respect to dynamic topologies.

\emph{Ant based Routing with Congestion Control} (ARCC) is an ant-based algorithm for WSNs which focuses on congestion control of the network [].
This protocol is efficient in dealing with upstream congestion and performs better with respect to throughput, packet loss, and priority performance.
However, ARCC uses Intelligent Congestion Detection as a mechanism to measure the time interval between two sequential packets arriving.
ADHOP uses only pheromone to avoid transparently the probable congestion and additional overhead.

\emph{Ant-Based On-Demand Energy Route} (AOER) is a routing algorithm for IEEE 802.15.4 mesh networks based on AODV [].
Differently from other protocols based on ACO, AOER requires less memory storage, less processing power, and simpler data structures for ants and routing table.
The algorithm maintains the routes by inserting pheromone according to the residual energy in the nodes to distribute the traffic or the data flow equally in the network.
AOER has shown satisfactory results in prolonging the network lifetime and balancing energy consumption among nodes.
The authors present a solution similar to ADHOP taking into account the reduction of memory usage and processing.
However, AOER uses a mechanism that hinders the data delivery ratio to obtain an efficient energy consumption in the network.

Vlajic and Stevanovic [] analyzed the pros and cons of deploying path-constrained mobile sinks in real IEEE 802.15.4 networks.
They introduced two basic mechanisms for the reduction of mobility-related overhead in WSNs.
They also demonstrated analytically and through simulation that, in idealist networks, mobile sinks can result in a better distribution of routing load and longer network lifetime.
F\"orster and Murphy [] proposed \emph{Feedback Routing for Optimization Multiple Sinks} (FROMS), a routing protocol which supports node failure, sink mobility, and applies a model-free reinforcement learning technique to achieve suboptimal solutions.
They present a formal definition of the multiple sink routing problem as a reinforcement learning task.
They also show that the expense of learning and the low overhead to piggyback reward information significantly lowers routing costs.
The authors also proposed the evaluation and discussion of FROMS implementation on \emph{ScatterWeb} sensor nodes [].
They demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a machine learning protocol on real hardware, verifying its increased performance in comparison to traditional approaches.
They also offer some general observations on properties and pitfalls of WSN implementations along with potential solutions.
