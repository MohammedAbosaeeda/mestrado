  abstract =	 "MPI (Message Passing Interface) is a specification for
                  a standard library for message passing that was
                  defined by the MPI Forum, a broadly based group of
                  parallel computer vendors, library writer, and
                  application specialists. Multiple implementations of
                  MPI have been developed. In this paper, we describe
                  MPICH, unique among existing implementations in its
                  design goal of combining portability with high
                  performance. We document its portability and
                  performance and describe the architecture by which
                  these features are simultaneously achieved. We also
                  discuss the set of tools that accompany the free
                  distribution of MPICH, which constitute the beginnings
                  of a portable parallel programming environment. A
                  project of this scope inevitably imparts lessons about
                  parallel computing, the specification being followed,
                  the current hardware and software environment for
                  parallel computing, and project management; we
                  describe those we have learned. Finally, we discuss
                  future developments for MPICH, including those
                  necessary to accommodate extensions to the MPI
                  Standard now being comtemplated by the MPI Forum."

  abstract =	 "The objects that occur in scientific applications can
                  be classified into spatial structures, e.g. meshes,
                  grids, or graphs, and (numerical) data that are
                  associated with these structures, e.g. grid functions
                  and (sparse) matrices. Our C++ template library Janus
                  rests on the observation that the spatial structures
                  are conceptually more stable than the associated
                  data. Janus provides a conceptual framework and
                  generic components for mesh-based scientific
                  applications. An outstanding feature of Janus is its
                  unified treatment of regular and irregular
                  structures. Our library has been developed using the
                  paradigm of generic programming and is portably
                  implemented on top of the Standard Template
                  Library. It runs on top of MPI, but it can also be put
                  onto other parallel platforms. "
