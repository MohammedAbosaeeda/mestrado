\opening{Dear Prof. Zomaya,}
\setlength{\parskip}{1.5ex}

We would like to submit the attached manuscript, ``Towards Unified Design of Hardware and Software
Components Using C++'', for consideration for possible publication in the IEEE Transactions on
Computers. This manuscript is a revised version of the manuscript, "Unified Design of Hardware and
Software Components", initially submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Computers on July 2012 (log
number TC-2012-06-0397.R1). We have annexed to the manuscript a rebuttal letter to the latest
reviews. This letter contains a detailed description of the changes performed in this revised
version.

We would like to recommend the same editor we have recommended in the last submission, Prof. Dr.
Radu Marculescu, due to his expertise in the area of system-level design. 

Regarding the option of preferred reviewers, we would also like to recommend the same reviewers that
were allocated for the last submission, since they are already familiar with the manuscript and the
changes performed in this revision were driven by the reviewers' comments.

Sincerely,

\closing{~}
