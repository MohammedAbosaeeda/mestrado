  ABSTRACT = {Wireless sensor networks are composed of large
                  numbers of tiny networked devices that communicate
                  untethered. For large scale networks it is important
                  to be able to dynamically download code into the
                  network. In this paper we present Contiki, a
                  lightweight operating system with support for
                  dynamic loading and replacement of individual
                  programs and services. Contiki is built around an
                  event-driven kernel but provides optional preemptive
                  multithreading that can be applied to individual
                  processes. We show that dynamic loading and
                  unloading is feasible in a resource constrained
                  environment, while keeping the base system
                  lightweight and compact.},

	done to reduce the runtime overhead caused by the VM. The framework
	is formed by an interpreter-based engine which executes Java bytecode,
	a lightweight API for accessing devices, and an OS (OS*) support
	for scheduling and dynamic memory management. Dynamic update support
	is carried out by an incremental linker \cite{Koshy2005} and a bootloader
	which are added in the system only if the application evolution is
	likely. To reduce the code shifts between two updates, it is left
	a slop space among functions. Thus, when functions grow or shrink,
	there is not needed to change the functions' place in the memory,
	decreasing the overhead. On the other hand, this approach increases
	the memory usage. The VM provides instructions (e.g copy, run and
	add) to execute the updating. In comparisons with Maté and TinyOS,

	ADC, SPI and so on. Tapper has been used in a variety of sensor platforms,
	and can run in several microcontrollers (MCU), for example, from
	AVR 8 bits MCU that has 4KB of RAM to a Freescale 16 bits MCU over
	TCP/IP protocol. The VM has a code size that range from 3KB to 11KB

	The reconfiguration process is executed by the instructions "+",

	instructions are carried out by a host machine that has the knowledge
	about data and program memory usage on the node. On the host machine,
	the "+" instruction is translated to the memory command "w:x:....",

  review = {Molecule is an adaptive dynamic reconfiguration mechanism that can
	be used in sensor operating system. In this scheme, applications,
	kernel features and device drivers are considered modules. Molecule
	supports two different approaches for linking the modules: direct
	and indirect linking. Based on a cost analisys of the expected execution
	time of each module, the mechanism chooses between direct or indirect
	linking. In the direct linking approach, every calling address of
	the modules that are being called by other modules must be updated.
	Thus, it increases the reconfiguration costs in terms of processing
	and energy, but it does not increase overhead on calling functions
	or accessing data between modules. In the indirect update mode, every
	calling address is performed thrugh a function table that contains
	the functions' addresses. Thus, when perfoming the uptading, only
	the addresses in this table are updated. Indirect linking increases
	execution time and code size, but the reconfiguration process is
	faster and easy. The linking process is executed in the node, ocurring
	an overhead in terms of energy, processing and memory for the nodes.
	To reduce this overhead, the authors proposed a remote linker, that
	is, the linking process is performed in a base station with bigger
	processing power and memory capabilities. The authors do not mention
	how they handle a return address when it is changed during a updating
	nor global variables and execution funtions.},

@inproceedings{JPFassino02,
	abstract = {Building a flexible kernel from components is a promising solution for supporting various embedded systems. The use of components encourages code re-use and reduces development time. Flexibility permits the system to be configured at various stages of the design, up to run time. In this paper, we propose a software framework, called THINK, for implementing operating system kernels from components of arbitrary sizes. A unique feature of THINK is that it provides a uniform and highly flexible binding model to help OS architects assemble operating system components in varied ways. An OS architect can build an OS kernel from components using THINK without being forced into a predefined kernel design (e.g. exo-kernel, micro-kernel or classical OS kernel). To evaluate the THINK framework, we have implemented KORTEX, a library of commonly used kernel components. We have used KORTEX to implement several kernels, including an L4-like micro-kernel, and kernels for an active network router, for the Kaffe Java virtual machine, and for a Doom game. Performance measurements show no degradation due to componentization and the systematic use of the binding framework, and that application-specific kernels can achieve speed-ups over standard general-purpose operating systems such as Linux.},
