  ABSTRACT =     {Technological progress in integrated, low-power, CMOS
                  communication devices and sensors makes a rich design
                  space of networked sensors viable. They can be deeply
                  embedded in the physical world and spread throughout
                  our environment like smart dust. The missing elements
                  are an overall system architecture and a methodology
                  for systematic advance. To this end, we identify key
                  requirements, develop a small device that is
                  representative of the class, design a tiny
                  event-driven operating system, and show that it
                  provides support for efficient modularity and
                  concurrency-intensive operation. Our operating system
                  fits in 178 bytes of memory, propagates events in the
                  time it takes to copy 1.25 bytes of memory, context
                  switches in the time it takes to copy 6 bytes of
                  memory and supports two level scheduling. The analysis
                  lays a groundwork for future architectural advances.}

  ABSTRACT =     {The MANTIS MultimodAl system for NeTworks of In-situ
                  wireless Sensors provides a new multithreaded embedded
                  operating system integrated with a general-purpose
                  single-board hardware platform to enable flexible and
                  rapid prototyping of wireless sensor networks. The key
                  design goals of MANTIS are ease of use, i.e. a small
                  learning curve that encourages novice programmers to
                  rapidly prototype novel sensor networking applications
                  in software and hardware, as well as flexibility, so
                  that expert researchers can leverage or develop
                  advanced software features and hardware extensions to
                  suit the needs of advanced research in wireless sensor
                  networks.}
