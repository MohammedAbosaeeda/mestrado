\begin{letter}{ACM Transactions on Computer Systems\\
    Editor-in-Chief\\
    Professor Emeritus Carla Schlatter Ellis}
\opening{Dear Prof. Ellis,}
\setlength{\parskip}{1.5ex}

I would like to submit the attached manuscript, "Periodic Timers
Revisited: the Real-time Embedded System Perspective", for consideration
for possible publication in the ACM Transactions on Computer Systems.

In respect to a nomination for editor, I am not sure about TOCS
policy, but your work on Sensor Networks has a good interface to the
manuscript. If the editor-in-chief is not a possibility, our second
nominee would be Prof.~Mowry for his work on operating systems.

Regarding the option of nominating reviewers, my two nominees are:

\begin{tabular}{p{.45\textwidth} p{.45\textwidth}}
  Hermann Kopetz & Franz Rammig\\
Technische Universtität Wien & Universität Paderborn\\
Institut für Technische Informatik & Heinz Hixdorf Institute\\
+43 1 58801 / 18210 & +49 5251 606500\\
hk@vmars.tuwien.ac.at & franz@upb.de\\
\end{tabular}

Both Prof. Kopetz and Prog. Rammig have a long publication list on
real-time embedded systems and have advised PhDs in areas close to
that of the manuscript. The nominees for editor and reviewers have no
conflict of interest with any of the authors of the paper being
submitted.
 
This paper has not been published or accepted for publication and it
is not under consideration at another journal. Although we mention a
previous paper on the subject in the manuscript, we do not consider
this to be an extension of that. The first was mostly a motivation for
the experiments described in the manuscript.  Nevertheless, should it
be consider an extension by the editorial board, it is certainly far
above the 25\% new content line.

Sincerely,

\closing{~}
