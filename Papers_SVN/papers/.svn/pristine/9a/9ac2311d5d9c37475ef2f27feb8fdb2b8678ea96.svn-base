Properly bridging a parallel architecture to a given class of parallel
applications is a defying task that calls for custom designed run-time
support systems. Only in this way would applications get
minimal-overhead system services delivered through application-oriented
interfaces. Designing and implementing a new run-time support system for
each class of parallel applications, however, would be impracticable in
terms of costs. Notwithstanding, software component engineering could
help to meet a compromise with applications by means of tailorable
run-time systems.  This paper describes a strategy to develop component
frameworks for parallel computing based on the Application- Oriented
System Design method proposed by Fröhlich [3]. These frameworks are the
substrata to build tailorable run-time support systems.


Keywords: application-oriented system design, component frameworks,
aspect-oriented programming, static metaprogramming, generative
programming.
