\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\paragraph{Theme}
Routing in mobile wireless sensor networks.

\paragraph{Scope}
Heuristics for energy-aware routing.

ACO (\emph{Ant Colony Optimization}) is a metaheuristic approach inspired by the behavior of ant colonies to solve combinatorial optimization problems.
