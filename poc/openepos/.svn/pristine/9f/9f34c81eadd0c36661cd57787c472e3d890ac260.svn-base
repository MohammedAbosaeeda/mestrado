This folder is just a copy of the Java program and its NanoVM tool 
optimized version (file nvmdefault.h).

The files, in this folder, are just for documentation purposes.

In order to REALLY compile and run the application you should compile it as a
normal EPOS application, just remember to:

- set nanovm_app as the APPLICATION in makedefs and 
- copy the nvmdefault.h of your application to src/vm.
