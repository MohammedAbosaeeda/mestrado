\begin{abstract}
This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a trustful infrastructure for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).
This infrastructure is composed by an embedded platform, EPOSMote II, and a communication protocol stack (TCP/IP/C-MAC).
We focus on security and reliability while still compromised with the low utilization of resources available in sensor nodes. 
%To achieve confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, we make use of data encryption and a temporal authentication scheme.
To achieve confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, we make use of data encryption and authentication.
Differently from other approaches our authentication scheme possesses a temporal property which protects the network against replay attacks.
Our proposal is evaluated in terms of processing time, memory footprint, and energy consumption presenting very little overhead.

%We make use of the hardware-assisted security mechanism present in EPOSMote II to encrypt and decrypt all transmitted data using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
%Although communication in WSNs is error-prone, TCP provides reliable and ordered packet delivery.
%As to not redo TCP's work we make use of the Configurable Medium Access Control (C-MAC) in the data link layer.
%To this end we configured C-MAC in a very simplistic form, using only CSMA and backoff periods.
%Furthermore, we make use of the Hardware-assisted security mechanism present in EPOSMote II to encrypt and decrypt all transmitted data using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
