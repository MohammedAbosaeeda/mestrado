  ABSTRACT =	 {Recent advances in wireless sensor networks have led
                  to many new protocols specifically designed for sensor
                  networks where energy awareness is an essential
                  consideration. Most of the attention, however, has
                  been given to the routing protocols since they might
                  differ depending on the application and network
                  architecture. This paper surveys recent routing
                  protocols for sensor networks and presents a
                  classification for the various approaches pursued. The
                  three main categories explored in this paper are
                  data-centric, hierarchical and location-based. Each
                  routing protocol is described and discussed under the
                  appropriate category. Moreover, protocols using
                  contemporary methodologies such as network flow and
                  quality of service modeling are also discussed. The
                  paper concludes with open research issues.}

                  there is significant interest in applying garbage
                  collection to hard real-time systems. Past approaches
                  have generally suffered from one of two major flaws:
                  either they were not provably real-time, or they
                  imposed large space overheads to meet the real-time
                  bounds. We present a mostly non-moving, dynamically
                  defragmenting collector that overcomes both of these
                  limitations: by avoiding copying in most cases, space
                  requirements are kept low; and by fully
                  incrementalizing the collector we are able to meet
                  real-time bounds. We implemented our algorithm in the
                  Jikes RVM and show that at real-time resolution we are
                  able to obtain mutator utilization rates of 45\% with
                  only 1.6--2.5 times the actual space required by the
                  application, a factor of 4 improvement in utilization
                  over the best previously published
                  results. Defragmentation causes no more than 4\% of
                  the traced data to be copied."

  abstract =	 "Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is a popular
                  energy-saving technique for real-time tasks. The
                  effectiveness of DVS critically depends on the
                  accuracy of workload estimation, since DVS exploits
                  the slack or the difference between the deadline and
                  execution time. Many existing DVS techniques are
                  profile based and simply utilize the worst-case or
                  average execution time without estimation. Several
                  recent approaches recognize the importance of workload
                  estimation and adopt statistical estimation
                  techniques. However, these approaches still require
                  extensive profiling to extract reliable workload
                  statistics and furthermore cannot effectively handle
                  time-varying workloads. Feedback-control-based
                  adaptive algorithms have been proposed to handle such
                  nonstationary workloads, but their results are often
                  too sensitive to parameter selection. To overcome
                  these limitations of existing approaches, we propose a
                  novel workload estimation technique for DVS. This
                  technique is based on the Kalman filter and can
                  estimate the processing time of workloads in a robust
                  and accurate manner by adaptively calibrating
                  estimation error by feedback. We tested the proposed
                  method with workloads of various characteristics
                  extracted from eight MPEG video clips. To thoroughly
                  evaluate the performance of our approach, we used both
                  a cycle-accurate simulator and an XScale-based test
                  board. Our simulation result demonstrates that the
                  proposed technique outperforms the compared
                  alternatives with respect to the ability to meet given
                  timing and Quality of Service
                  constraints. Furthermore, we found that the accuracy
                  of our approach is almost comparable to the oracle
                  accuracy achievable only by offline
                  analysis. Experimental results indicate that using our
                  approach can reduce energy consumption by 57.5\% on
                  average, only with negligible deadline miss ratio
                  (DMR) around 6.1\%. Moreover, the average of
                  computational overheads for the proposed technique is
                  just 0.3\%, which is the minimum value compared to
                  other met- hods. More importantly, the DMR of our
                  method is bounded by 11.7\% in the worst case, while
                  those of other methods are twice or more than ours."

                  highly efficient methods for distributing queries to
                  nodes that have observed interesting events in the
                  network. A highly efficient data-centric routing
                  mechanism will offer significant power cost
                  reductions, and improve network longevity. Moreover,
                  because of the large amount of system and data
                  redundancy possible, data becomes disassociated from
                  specific node and resides in regions of the
                  network. This paper describes and evaluates through
                  simulation a scheme we call Rumor Routing, which
                  allows for queries to be delivered to events in the
                  network. Rumor Routing is tunable, and allows for
                  tradeoffs between setup overhead and delivery
                  reliability. It’s intended for contexts in which
                  geographic routing criteria are not applicable because
                  a coordinate system is not available or the phenomenon
                  of interest is not geographically correlated.}

                  formulate both dynamic power management (DPM) and
                  dynamic voltage-frequency scaling problems as one of
                  workload characterization and selection and solve them
                  using our algorithm. The selection is done among a set
                  of experts, which refers to a set of DPM policies and
                  voltage-frequency settings, leveraging the fact that
                  different experts outperform each other under
                  different workloads and device leakage
                  characteristics. The online-learning algorithm adapts
                  to changes in the characteristics and guarantees fast
                  convergence to the best-performing expert. In our
                  evaluation, we perform experiments on a hard disk
                  drive (HDD) and Intel PXA27x core (CPU) with real-life
                  workloads. Our results show that our algorithm adapts
                  really well and achieves an overall performance
                  comparable to the best-performing expert at any point
                  in time, with energy savings as high as 61\% and 49\%
                  for HDD and CPU, respectively. Moreover, it is
                  extremely lightweight and has negligible overhead."

                  communication devices and sensors makes a rich design
                  space of networked sensors viable. They can be deeply
                  embedded in the physical world and spread throughout
                  our environment like smart dust. The missing elements
                  are an overall system architecture and a methodology
                  for systematic advance. To this end, we identify key
                  requirements, develop a small device that is
                  representative of the class, design a tiny
                  event-driven operating system, and show that it
                  provides support for efficient modularity and
                  concurrency-intensive operation. Our operating system
                  fits in 178 bytes of memory, propagates events in the
                  time it takes to copy 1.25 bytes of memory, context
                  switches in the time it takes to copy 6 bytes of
                  memory and supports two level scheduling. The analysis
                  lays a groundwork for future architectural advances.}

                  neither procedural nor object-oriented programming
                  techniques are sufficient to clearly capture some of
                  the important design decisions the program must
                  implement. This forces the implementation of those
                  design decisions to be scattered through-out the code,
                  resulting in 'tangled' code that is excessively
                  difficult to develop and maintain. We present an
                  analysis of why certain design decisions have been so
                  difficult to clearly capture in actual code. We call
                  the properties these decisions address aspects, and
                  show that the reason they have been hard to capture is
                  that they cross-cut the system's basic
                  functionality. We present the basis for a new
                  programming technique, called aspect-oriented
                  programming, that makes it possible to clearly express
                  programs involving such aspects, including appropriate
                  isolation, composition and re-use of the aspect
                  code. The discussion is rooted in systems we have
                  built using aspect-oriented programming.}

  ABSTRACT =	 {Composed of tens of thousands of tiny devices with
                  very limited resources (``motes''), sensor networks
                  are subject to novel systems problems and
                  constraints. The large number of motes in a sensor
                  network means that there will often be some failing
                  nodes; networks must be easy to repopulate. Often
                  there is no feasible method to recharge motes, so
                  energy is a precious resource. Once deployed, a
                  network must be reprogrammable although physically
                  unreachable, and this reprogramming can be a
                  significant energy cost. We present Maté, a tiny
                  communication-centric virtual machine designed for
                  sensor networks. Maté's high-level interface allows
                  complex programs to be very short (under 100 bytes),
                  reducing the energy cost of transmitting new
                  programs. Code is broken up into small capsules of 24
                  instructions, which can self-replicate through the
                  network. Packet sending and reception capsules enable
                  the deployment of ad-hoc routing and data aggregation
                  algorithms. Mate's concise,high-level program
                  representation simplifies programming and allows large
                  networks to be frequently reprogrammed in an
                  energy-effcient manner; in addition, its safe
                  execution environment suggests a use of virtual
                  machines to provide the user/kernel boundary on motes
                  that have no hardware protection mechanisms.}

  ABSTRACT =	 {We provide an in-depth study of applying wireless
                  sensor networks to real-world habitat monitoring. A
                  set of system design requirements are developed that
                  cover the hardware design of the nodes, the design of
                  the sensor network, and the capabilities for remote
                  data access and management. A system architecture is
                  proposed to address these requirements for habitat
                  monitoring in general, and an instance of the
                  architecture for monitoring seabird nesting
                  environment and behavior is presented. The currently
                  deployed network consists of 32 nodes on a small
                  island off the coast of Maine streaming useful live
                  data onto the web. The application-driven design
                  exercise serves to identify important areas of further
                  work in data sampling, communications, network
                  retasking, and health monitoring.}

  abstract =	 "Managing energy consumption has become vitally
                  important to battery-operated portable and em- bedded
                  systems. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) reduces the
                  processor~s dynamic power consump- tion quadratically
                  at the expense of linearly decreasing the
                  performance. When reducing energy with DVS for
                  real-time systems, one must consider the performance
                  penalty to ensure that dead- lines can be met. In this
                  paper, we introduce a novel collaborative approach
                  between the compiler and the operating system (OS) to
                  reduce energy consumption. We use the compiler to
                  annotate an application~s source code with
                  path-dependent information called power-management
                  hints (PMHs). This ~ne-grained information captures
                  the temporal behavior of the application, which varies
                  by executing different paths. During program
                  execution, the OS periodically changes the processor~s
                  frequency and voltage based on the temporal
                  information provided by the PMHs. These speed
                  adaptation points are called power-management points
                  (PMPs). We evaluate our scheme using three embedded
                  applications: a video decoder, automatic target
                  recognition, and a sub-band tuner. Our scheme shows an
                  energy reduction of up to 57% over no power-management
                  and up to 32% over a static power-management
                  scheme. We compare our scheme to other schemes that
                  solely uti- lize PMPs for power-management and show
                  experimentally that our scheme achieves more energy
                  savings. We also analyze the advantages and
                  disadvantages of our approach relative to another
                  compiler-directed scheme. "

                  operating system (OS)-directed power management. The
                  primary focus of previous research has been the
                  development of better policies. In this paper, we
                  provide evidence that one policy may outperform
                  another under different conditions. Hence, it is
                  difficult, or even impossible, to design the 'best'
                  policy for all computers. We explain how to select the
                  best policies at runtime without user or administrator
                  intervention by using a software framework called the
                  homogeneous architecture for power policy integration
                  (HAPPI). This architecture is portable across
                  different platforms running Linux. HAPPI specifies
                  common requirements for policies and provides an
                  interface to simplify the implementation of policies
                  in a commodity OS. Our approach allows these policies
                  to be compared simultaneously to select the best
                  policy among a set of distinct policies at
                  runtime. Experimental results indicate that HAPPI
                  achieves energy savings within 4 percent of the best
                  individual policy for each device in several computing
                  systems without a priori knowledge of workloads."

  abstract =	 "Dynamic power management aims ar extending battery
                  life by switching devices to lower-power modes when
                  there is a reduced demand for service. Static power
                  management strategies can lead to poor performance or
                  unnecessary power consumption when there are wide
                  variations in the rate of requests for service. This
                  paper presents a hierarchical scheme for adaptive
                  dynamic power management (DPM) under nonstationary
                  service requests. As the main theoretical
                  contribution, we model the nonstationary request
                  process as a Markov-modulated process with a
                  collection of modes, each corresponding to a
                  particular stationary request process. Optimal DPM
                  policies are precalculated offline for selected modes
                  using standard algorithms available for stationary
                  Markov decision processes (MDPs). The power manager
                  then switches online among these policies to
                  accommodate the stochastic mode-switching request
                  dynamics using an adaptive algorithm to determine the
                  optimal switching rule based on the observed sample
                  path. As a target application, we present simulations
                  of hierarchical DPM for hard disk drives where the
                  read/write request arrivals are modeled as a
                  Markov-modulated Poisson process. Simulation results
                  show that the power consumption of our approach under
                  highly nonstationary request arrivals is less than
                  that of a previously proposed heuristic approach and
