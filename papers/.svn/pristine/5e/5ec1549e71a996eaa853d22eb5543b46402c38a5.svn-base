This section discusses a set of routing algorithms developed to minimize energy consumption of wireless networks.
These energy-aware algorithms base their routing decisions on the information about usage and availability of energy.
Depending on the approach, nodes take into account energy information about themselves, their neighbors, or both.
Nodes use this information in either cooperative or competitive approaches to save energy and/or balance the energy consumption in the network.
% These algorithms try to increase the data delivery ratio due to a better network connectivity.
% This happens because they prevent nodes from running out of energy too soon.

%- GREES
Zeng et al.~\cite{Zeng:2009} proposed GREES (\emph{Geographic Routing with Environmental Energy Supply}) -- an energy-aware routing protocol that takes both geographic positioning and energy consumption into consideration.
Besides location and energy consumption, it also takes into account the lossy channel condition usually featured by WSNs, battery charge, and environmental energy supply to estimate a cost for each link.
At runtime, GREES uses the routes with the lowest estimated cost.
When compared to ADHOP, GREES generates extra network traffic to keep the information about the node's neighborhood up-to-date.
Moreover, GREES consumes more storage and processing resources at the nodes to maintain tables with location, residual energy, energy harvesting ratio, energy consumption ratio, and link quality information of each neighbor.

%
Li and Shi~\cite{Li:2008} introduced AACS (\emph{Adaptive Ant Colony System}).
This is a data-centric routing protocol that distributes interest messages with \emph{direct diffusion} and uses ACO to build the MST (\emph{Minimum Steiner Tree}) of the network.
The algorithm uses the MST to aggregate data on the network.
This reduces the amount of packets and, therefore, saves energy and prolong network lifetime.
In systems with dynamic topologies, however, the overhead for updating the MST may overcome the benefits in terms of energy consumption, jeopardizing the network lifetime.

%- AOER
Shuang et al.~\cite{Shuang:2009} proposed AOER (\emph{Ant-based On-de\-mand Energy Route}) for IEEE 802.15.4 mesh networks.
It is an ACO-based routing algorithm that aims at reducing in-node overhead using simpler data structures and algorithms, resulting in reduced use of memory, CPU, and power.
AOER inserts pheromone in the routes based on its energy characteristics.
These characteristics include information about residual energy in the neighborhood, in the route, or in the whole network.
Results presented by AOER case-studies show a significant enhancement of network lifetime.
ADHOP shares the AOER approach of using simpler data structures to store routing information.
However, AOER uses a mechanism that hinders the data delivery ratio to obtain an efficient energy consumption in the network.
If the consumption exceeds the thresholds set by the protocol, the algorithm interrupts the data transmission until achieves the expected consumption at that moment.
On this issue, the EA-ADHOP approach aims at improving the energy consumption of the network without compromising the delivery ratio.

%- AODV
Perkins and Royer~\cite{Perkins:1999} developed AODV (\emph{Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector}) -- a reactive routing protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks based on distance vectors.
AODV defines routes by exchanging messages.
These messages either request routes, reply with a route or report an error.
In highly mobile scenarios with high rates of data loss, AODV increases network overhead with its control messages.
This happens because AODV floods the network with route request messages whenever a route breaks.
%{\bf How do we avoid flooding in ADHOP?}
Differently, ADHOP does not use control messages to warn routing errors or recover broken routes.
It uses the pheromone variation toward the destination to infer changes in the topology.
As a result, the ants adapt to dynamic to\-pologies, hop-by-hop, without increasing the routing overhead in the network.
