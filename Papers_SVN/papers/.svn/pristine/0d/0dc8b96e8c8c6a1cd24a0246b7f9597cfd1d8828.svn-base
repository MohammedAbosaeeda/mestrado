Most of the communication systems used to support high performance
computing in clusters of workstations have been designed focusing on
"the best" solution for a certain network architecture. However, a
definitive best solution, independently of how well tuned to the
underlying hardware it is, cannot exist, for parallel applications
communicate in quite different ways. In this paper, we describe a novel
design method that supports the construction of run-time systems as an
assemblage of components that can be configured to closely match the
demands of any given application. We also describe how this method has
been deployed in the development of a communication system in the realm
of EPOS, a project that aims at delivering automatically generated
application-oriented run-time support systems.  The communication system
in question has been implemented for a cluster of PCs interconnected
with Myrinet, and corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed design
method.
