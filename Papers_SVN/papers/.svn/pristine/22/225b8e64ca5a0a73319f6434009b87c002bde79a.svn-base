  abstract =	 " The Intel 82C54 is a high-performance, CHMOS version
                  of the industry standard 8254 counter/timer which is
                  designed to solve the timing control problems common
                  in microcomputer system design. It provides three
                  independent 16-bit counters, each capable of handling
                  clock inputs up to 10 MHz. All modes are software
                  programmable. The 82C54 is pin compatible with the
                  HMOS 8254, and is a superset of the 8253. Six
                  programmable timer modes allow the 82C54 to be used as
                  an event counter, elapsed time indicator, programmable
                  one-shot, and in many other applications. The 82C54 is
                  fabricated on Intel's advanced CHMOS III technology
                  which provides low power consumption with performance
                  equal to or greater than the equivalent HMOS
                  product. The 82C54 is available in 24-pin DIP and
                  28-pin plastic leaded chip carrier (PLCC) packages."
