%\begin{abstract}
%Embedded systems are increasing in complexity, while several metrics as time-to-market, reliability, safety and performance should the considering during the design of such systems. Frequently, the design of such systems imposes an integrated hardware/software design to cope with such metrics. In this sense, a component-based design methodology with components that can freely migrate through hardware and software domain benefits the process of design such systems. Moreover, a design based on higher-level abstraction enable a better design space exploration between several hardware and software compositions. We define hybrid hardware and software components as a development artifact that can be deployed by different combinations of hardware and software elements. In this paper, we present an architecture for developing such components in order to construct a repository of components that can migrate between the hardware and software domains to meet the design system requirements.
