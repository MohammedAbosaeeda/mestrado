\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conc}
This paper introduces a method used to abstract hardware devices in order to
be used by VHLLs applications in the embedded system scenario.
This method can be used for constructing hardware components libraries for
embedded VHLLs applications.
It is also presented EBG, a tool which automates the task of generating native
code adapters.
The EBG shows that, when hardware devices and FFIs are properly factorated,
the adaptation of a hardware device to a VHLL can be treated as an aspect
weaving problem thus, enabling the reuse of native code adapters by distinct
FFIs.

The proposal was applied for embedded \java~and embedded \lua, in three cases
study.
Four hardware mediators were evaluated, UART, DMEC, TemperatureSensor, and NIC.
The overhead of time and memory was less than 1.3\% take in to consideration all
cases, which indicates that our approach if feasible for embedded systems.
Applications were deployed in the IA32, AVR8, ARM7, and PPC32 architectures,
showing the portability of the native code adapters developed using the proposed
approach.
