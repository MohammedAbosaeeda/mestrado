   % Theme:  Automated test
   % Scope:  Automated execution tests for helping developer debug the source code.
   % Goal:   Automated test execution by modifying parameters of application and reporting to the developer.  
Debugging is one of the most time-consuming process in software developmen. The debugging task for embedded systems brings some additional problems in the process, since the developer should perform it in different platforms, which vary accordingly to the architecture and vendor. 
This paper presents the automatic exchange of configuration parameters as one anatomic part of fully automated debug. Also, we construct an environment for cross debugging embedded applications based on specific hardware/software requirements.
A real-world application was debugged using the proposed automation in a tailored environment. The obtained results indicates that even a small part of the fully automated debug produce answers to help developers find and fix a bug.
