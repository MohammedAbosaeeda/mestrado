----------------------- REVIEW --------------------
Paper overview:
The paper presents measurements of the performance on EPOS. The
architecture and characteristics of this system are only discussed
briefly, but the concepts behind it sound very intriguing.

Comments to authors:
The exact solution to the dining philosophers used would be
interesting. On the other hand, some more mainstream real-time
benchmark, like Hartstone, or some generic benchmark would be more
appropiate for comparison purposes.

There are of typoes and grammar errors in the paper.
