\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
This paper presented an OS runtime reprogramming infrastructure for WSN which consists of a data dissemination protocol and ELUS. %, an OS support environment.
%The protocol ensures correct delivery of all data to all  nodes of the network, and the environment allows runtime reconfiguration of the system without data loss. 
The infrastructure was tested in a WSN with real nodes, Mica2, and evaluated in terms of memory consumption, and dissemination and reprogramming time.
Our results corroborate our design choices, with figures better than that present in related work.
We have also reduced ELUS memory consumption by more than 50\% by using C++ templates specialization techniques.
