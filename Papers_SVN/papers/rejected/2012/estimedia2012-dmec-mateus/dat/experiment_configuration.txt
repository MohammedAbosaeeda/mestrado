Total: 60 measurements.

OR

JM+DMEC only measure 6 workers so 12 + 8 = 20 measurements.

20 + 8 JM original = 28 measurements.

Final TOTAL: 28 measurements.

We already got measurements for 6 workers at CELL 
(see https://svn.lisha.ufsc.br/project/h264/relatorios_tecnicos/2011-junho/h264_cod_cluster-relatorio_final.pdf) but for a "unknown QP".
