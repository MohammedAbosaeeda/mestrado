  ABSTRACT = {We have found many programming problems for which
                  neither procedural nor object-oriented programming
                  techniques are sufficient to clearly capture some of
                  the important design decisions the program must
                  implement. This forces the implementation of those
                  design decisions to be scattered through-out the code,
                  resulting in 'tangled' code that is excessively
                  difficult to develop and maintain. We present an
                  analysis of why certain design decisions have been so
                  difficult to clearly capture in actual code. We call
                  the properties these decisions address aspects, and
                  show that the reason they have been hard to capture is
                  that they cross-cut the system's basic
                  functionality. We present the basis for a new
                  programming technique, called aspect-oriented
                  programming, that makes it possible to clearly express
                  programs involving such aspects, including appropriate
                  isolation, composition and re-use of the aspect
                  code. The discussion is rooted in systems we have
                  built using aspect-oriented programming.}

  ABSTRACT = {Wireless Integrated Network Sensors (WINS) now provide a new monitoring and control capability for transportation, manufacturing, health care, environmental monitoring, and safety and security. WINS combine sensing, signal processing, decision capability, and wireless networking capability in a compact, low power system. WINS systems combine microsensor technology with low power sensor interface, signal processing, and RF communication circuits. The need for low cost presents engineering challenges for implementation of these systems in conventional digital CMOS technology. This paper describes micropower data converter, digital signal processing systems, and weak inversion CMOS RF circuits. The digital signal processing system relies on a continuously operating spectrum analyzer. Finally, the weak inversion CMOS RF systems are designed to exploit the properties of high-Q inductors to enable low power operation. This paper reviews system architecture and low power circuits for WINS.}

Most of the attention, however, has been given to the routing protocols since they might differ depending on the application and network architecture. This paper surveys recent routing protocols for sensor networks and presents a classification for the various approaches pursued. The three main categories explored in this paper are data-centric, hierarchical and location-based. Each routing protocol is described and discussed under the appropriate category. Moreover, protocols using contemporary methodologies such as network flow and quality of service modeling are also discussed. The paper concludes with open research issues.}

  ABSTRACT = {Advances in micro-sensor and radio technology will enable small but smart sensors to be deployed for a wide range of environmental monitoring applications. In order to constrain communication overhead, dense sensor networks call for new and highly efficient methods for distributing queries to nodes that have observed interesting events in the network. A highly efficient data-centric routing mechanism will offer significant power cost reductions, and improve network longevity. Moreover, because of the large amount of system and data redundancy possible, data becomes disassociated from specific node and resides in regions of the network. This paper describes and evaluates through simulation a scheme we call Rumor Routing, which allows for queries to be delivered to events in the network. Rumor Routing is tunable, and allows for tradeoffs between setup overhead and delivery reliability. Its intended for contexts in which geographic routing criteria are not applicable because a coordinate system is not available or the phenomenon of interest is not geographically correlated.}

They can be deeply embedded in the physical world and spread throughout our environment like smart dust. The missing elements are an overall system architecture and a methodology for systematic advance. To this end, we identify key requirements, develop a small device that is representative of the class, design a tiny event-driven operating system, and show that it provides support for efficient modularity and concurrency-intensive operation. Our operating system fits in 178 bytes of memory, propagates events in the time it takes to copy 1.25 bytes of memory, context switches in the time it takes to copy 6 bytes of memory and supports two level scheduling. The analysis lays a groundwork for future architectural advances.}

  ABSTRACT = {Composed of tens of thousands of tiny devices with very limited resources (``motes''), sensor networks are subject to novel systems problems and constraints. The large number of motes in a sensor network means that there will often be some failing nodes; networks must be easy to repopulate. Often there is no feasible method to recharge motes, so energy is a precious resource. Once deployed, a network must be reprogrammable although physically unreachable, and this reprogramming can be a significant energy cost. We present Maté, a tiny communication-centric virtual machine designed for sensor networks. Maté's high-level interface allows complex programs to be very short (under 100 bytes), reducing the energy cost of transmitting new programs. Code is broken up into small capsules of 24 instructions, which can self-replicate through the network. Packet sending and reception capsules enable the deployment of ad-hoc routing and data aggregation algorithms. Mate's concise,high-level program representation simplifies programming and allows large networks to be frequently reprogrammed in an energy-effcient manner; in addition, its safe execution environment suggests a use of virtual machines to provide the user/kernel boundary on motes that have no hardware protection mechanisms.}

A set of system design requirements are developed that cover the hardware design of the nodes, the design of the sensor network, and the capabilities for remote data access and management. A system architecture is proposed to address these requirements for habitat monitoring in general, and an instance of the architecture for monitoring seabird nesting environment and behavior is presented. The currently deployed network consists of 32 nodes on a small island off the coast of Maine streaming useful live data onto the web. The application-driven design exercise serves to identify important areas of further work in data sampling, communications, network retasking, and health monitoring.}

  abstract = {Dynamic power management is a design methodology aiming at controlling performance and power levels of digital circuits and systems, with the goal of extending the autonomous operation time of battery-powered systems, providing graceful performance degradation when supply energy is limited, and adapting power dissipation to satisfy environmental constraints. We survey system-level dynamic power management techniques. We first analyze idleness detection and shutdown mechanisms for idle hardware resources and we review industrial standards for operating system-based power management. We describe system-level stochastic models for the power/performance behavior of systems. We analyze different modeling assumptions and we discuss their validity and generality. Last, we describe methods for determining optimum power management strategies and also describe various validation methods that can be employed to assess the effectiveness of power-manageable architectures and the associated power-management schemes.}
