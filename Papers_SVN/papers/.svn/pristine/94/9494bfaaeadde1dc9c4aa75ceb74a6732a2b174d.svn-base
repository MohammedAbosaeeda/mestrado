COSET-1 REVIEW FORM
===================

Paper title:  An application-oriented parallel-programming system for
dedicated
              cluster computing

Authors:  Thiago Robert C. Santos, Antonio Augusto Frohlich

Reviewer confidence level (1-4): 4
1=not my area
2=general area knowledge
3=close to my area of expertise
4=my area of expertise


Summary of the paper:

This paper describes EPOS, the Embedded Parallel Operating System.  The
paper describes
the motivation for EPOS, provides an overview of the communication
system, and briefly
describes future work.


Strengths of the paper:

This paper touches on many important issues with operating systems and
communication
systems for HPC.


Weaknesses of the Paper:

Several of the arguments made in the paper are not substantiated with
empirical data.
The paper does not go into sufficient level of detail to understand
what's new and/or
different about EPOS.  The detailed description of Myrinet is
superfluous and could
have simply been referenced.  The paper has no related work section that
describes
how this work compliments, extends, or differs from other operating
system research
and development.


Interest for COSET-1:

The topics discussed in the paper are relevant to the workshop.

For the next four queries, please rate the paper on a scale of 1-4,
where
the quality increases as the number increases.

Originality: 2

Technical merit: 2

Readability: 3

Overall rating:  WEAK ACCEPT (3)
