A SoC platform supporting high-level synthesis for FPGAs

- Introduction
	+ Motivation:
		- SoCs are complex
		- ESL synthesis is at hand
		- The widespread use FPGA-based SoC is creating a growing demand 
		  for HLS solutions targeting such platforms
	+ COntributions:
		- A flexible NoC-based platform for SoC deployment in FPGAs
		- Demonstrates how HW/SW components can communicate seamlessly 
		  and be integrated and in a HLS-based SoC implementation flow
		  	
- HW/SW component communication
	+ Separation between communication and behavior. Mention SystemC
      channels, etc. Using OOP to describe components
	+ Assumptions about communication. Differences between hardware
	  and software.
	+ Mult/Add example (maybe)
	+ Transparent definition: Traits: hardware/software
	 	- Show metaprograms	
 		
- The system platform
	+ Show generic view of the platform with: NoC, processor node,
	  IO node, and component nodes
	+ RTSNoC
	+ EPOS
	   - Describe the implementation of proxys, agents and the runtime
	     support for communication
	   - EPOS syntatical analizer can be used to generate proxys and agents
	+ System integration
		- Describe in details the HW side of the flow
		- Show the steps from C++ to the systems running in the virtual platform
		  or in a FPGA
	+ Standalone results
		- Mibench running on the platform.
			+ Evaluates accuracy of the virtual platform and
			  the simulation time compared to full RTL simulation
		- Latency of calls using proxy/agents
		- Area proxy/agents
		- Comparison with related works

- PABX case study
	+ Diagram of PABX application and how it maps to the platform
	+ Results (DTMF detector and ADPCM codec)
		- For memory/area: stacked bars comparing the amount 
          used by components logic and communication logic
       - Performance
       - SoC total footprint considering different partiotionings

- Related works
	+ High-level synthesis for FPGAs
	+ HW/SW communication for FPGAs
	+ Other platforms (virtual and physical) for SoC-based FPGAs
   
- Conclusion
	+ In this paper we:
		- Propose a ﬂexible NoC-based platform for SoC deployment in FPGAs
		- Demonstrate how HW/SW components can be integrated seamlessly in 
		a HLS-based SoC implementation ﬂow
	+ Limitations: Current approach favors controll-oriented applications. 
	  New features will be considered in future works in order to provide 
	  a better support for high throughput data-oriented applications:
		-Streaming interfaces
		-DMA
