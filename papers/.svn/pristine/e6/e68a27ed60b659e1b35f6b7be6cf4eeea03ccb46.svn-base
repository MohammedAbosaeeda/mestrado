				Abstract

As commodity microprocessors and networks reach performance levels comparable to those used in massively parallel processors (MPPs), clusters of symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) are starting to be called the new supercomputers. It is already a fact that they provide a better cost/performance ration if compared to traditional MPPs, and maybe in a short time both technologies will converge into a single one.

	This paper discusses several aspects regarding the adoption of clusters of SMPs to support high performance computing, including software and hardware restrains to deliver processing power to parallel application, as well as the most innovative alternatives to overcome these restrains. Besides discussing the current state of cluster computing, the authors try to identify which should be the next steps to enable these low-cost machines to replace expensive MPPs.
