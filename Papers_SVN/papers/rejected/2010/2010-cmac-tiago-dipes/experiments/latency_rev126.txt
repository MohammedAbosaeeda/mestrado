Due to some unknown issues, it was not possible to execute the same test in this case.
So we just measured the send time from the coordinator. Since the latency is dominated 
by the duration of the sleep cycle, the round trip time can be considered to be very close
to the send time.
Parameters used: (for a 12% duty cycle)
DEFAULT_BEACON_ORDER	 	= 7,
DEFAULT_SUPERFRAME_ORDER	= 4,
