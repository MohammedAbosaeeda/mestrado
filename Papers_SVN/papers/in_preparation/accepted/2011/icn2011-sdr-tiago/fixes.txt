==== comment #1 ====
This paper presents Hybrid Radio Architecture (HYRA) and explores the Hybrid Hardware/ software Component concept to enable the implementation of SDRs (software Defined Radio) as direct mappings of high level synchronous data flow models. The paper presents a very interesting topic and is well documented.
References should all follow the standard presentation.
--------------------------

Ask Petre about the meaning of "References should all follow the standard presentation."

==== comment #2 ====
This paper presents HYRA, an architecture that enables the implementation of Software Defined Radios (SDR) in reconfigurable hardware platforms (i.e. FPGAs) for embedded systems. The implementation is based on direct mapping of a high level Synchronous Data Flow (SDF) model. The results show that HYRA is more efficient than GNU radios in terms of latency, when implemented in FPGAs.
The paper is well written and enough details are given when needed. The authors include a well written relevant work section. In addition, the motivation is pointed out clearly.

The main weakness of the paper is that the proposed implementation is relatively simple. In particular, it doesn’t take into account Digital Signal Processing (DSP) implementation aspects.
--------------------------------------

OK. There is nothing that could be fixed in the paper.

==== comment #3 ====
The authors present a hybrid architecture which builds a bridge between a pure software defined radio approach for wireless networks, which is flexible but expensive, and a pure hardware approach, which is cheap but typically restricted to perhaps only one technology.

My impression is that the authors provide a quite solid work of applied research. Perhaps, this no "rocket science" from a fundamental research viewpoint, but a solid work of applied research and engineering.

OK. There is nothing that could be fixed in the paper.
