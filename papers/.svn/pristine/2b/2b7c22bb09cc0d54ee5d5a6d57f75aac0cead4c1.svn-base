@inproceedings{Anderson:2006,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we present hthreads, a unifying programming model for
	specifying application threads running within a hybrid CPU/FPGA system.
	Threads are specified from a single pthreads multithreaded application
	program and compiled to run on the CPU or synthesized to run on the
	FPGA. The hthreads system, in general, is unique within the reconfigurable
	computing community as it abstracts the CPU/FPGA components into
	a unified custom threaded multiprocessor architecture platform. To
	support the abstraction of the CPU/FPGA component boundary, we have
	created the hardware thread interface (HWTI) component that frees
	the designer from having to specify and embed platform specific instructions
	to form customized hardware/ software interactions. Instead, the
	hardware thread interface supports the generalized pthreads API semantics,
	and allows passing of abstract data types between hardware and software
	threads. Thus the hardware thread interface provides an abstract,
	platform independent compilation target that enables thread and instruction-level
	parallelism across the software/hardware boundary.},
