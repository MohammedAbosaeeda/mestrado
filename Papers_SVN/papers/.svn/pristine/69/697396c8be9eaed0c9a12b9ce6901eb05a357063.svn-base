OK:
--------------------------------------
1- Explain better the trends of DSE in Introduction. -> mudar o foco para ESDesign.
2- What the authors mean by using "hardware". The term "configurable features" is not clear on the text. Stay more clear that hardware could be implemented as a collection of interconected ICs or by a FPGA, etc ... 
--configurable feature -> static.
3- Tie the results on the previous paper publish at RSP2006 !!!
4- Include a Thread Semaphore 

To Review:
--------------------------------------

5- Explain that every component on the system could behave as client and/or server to another component.
passagem de SW->HW mediator is proxy
