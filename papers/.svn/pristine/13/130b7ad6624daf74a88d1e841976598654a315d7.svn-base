\section{Implementation} \label{impl}
% + Implementation
% Describes our implementation for Linux@Cell, Linux@IA32 , and Hardware (obtained using HLS).
% Emphasizes our communication (data transference and synchronization)
% interfaces are the same for both architectures, they only differs at implementation.
This section describes our implementation of DMEC for the architectures
Cell BE, Multicore IA32, and dedicated hardware.
For each architecture, we present the reasons why we have implemented DMEC for
it.
We also briefly review the target architecture and explain how data transference
and synchronization was implemented, keeping the interfaces described in
Section \ref{dmec}.
