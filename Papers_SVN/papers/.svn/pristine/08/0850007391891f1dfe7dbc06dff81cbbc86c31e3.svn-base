\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
This paper presented a trustful infrastructure for WSNs within the EPOSMote project.
By trustful we mean reliable and secure.
This infrastructure is composed by the EPOSMote II platform, and a stack of communication protocols (TCP/IP/C-MAC).
We used the hardware-assisted security mechanism present in EPOSMote II, which supports AES in CCM mode.
Our proposal uses a centralized key distribution scheme, where each sensor shares a unique key with the base station.
By introducing time information into our packets we countermeasure replay attacks.

We experimentally evaluated our proposal in terms of memory consumption, encryption/decryption time, and energy consumption.
The results corroborate our proposal can provide confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and reliability without introducing a considerable overhead to the network.
