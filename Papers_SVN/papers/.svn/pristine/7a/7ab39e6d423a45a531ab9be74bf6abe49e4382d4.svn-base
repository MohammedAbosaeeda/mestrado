\section{Fundamentals of Solar Energy Harvesting} \label{fund}

Power management is one of the main research topics in wireless sensor networks.
Batteries, which have a limited energy capacity, are the most common option for powering sensors.

As shown in Table~\ref{tab:power}, different harvesting technologies present different power densities~\cite{Roundy:2003}.
Also, it is shown that the solar modality presents the highest power density.
However, many parameters should be taken into account when planning to operate a photovoltaic module including: solar irradiance, temperature variation, spacial positioning and the photovoltaic's electrical characteristics.
Through experimentation,  photovoltaic cells' power and current curves, like the ones in Figure~\ref{fig:pv_plot}, are obtained under known operating parameters (e.g. temperature of $25~^\circ C$ and an irradiance of $1000~W/m^{2}$).
These curves demonstrate that solar cells are remarkably versatile as they can operate from the state of open circuit -- where, theoretically, there is no current flowing -- to the state of short circuit -- where, theoretically, there is no voltage drop between the positive and negative terminals of the solar cell.
The solar cell power curve is nothing but the product of voltage and current values in \emph{y} and \emph{x} axis.
With this concept in mind, and assuming positive values for voltage and current, the power curve must have at least one maximum value.
In order to extract the maximum power of the environment, a solar panel must operate as close as possible to this maximum power point.
Normally, the maximum power is extracted from the solar panel by applying to it the $V_{MPP}$ (voltage at maximum power point).
Electronic circuits, called \emph{maximum power point trackers} (MPPT), are responsible for ensuring the operation on this point.

The idea of operating a solar panel as close as possible to its $V_{MPP}$ is not new \cite{Schoeman:1982}. The target of the first MPPTs were the satellites; therefore, the energy harvesting control was executed by circuits built on \emph{printed circuit boards} (PCBs). These PCBs were designed to attend loads up to hundreds of Watts. % Citation needed!!!
Later on, the MPPT concept was disseminated through the embedded systems operating on shore. The usage of printed circuit boards was maintained, and a new question has emerged as the embedded systems' power consumption decreased: Are MPPT circuits advantageous for low power applications, or their intrinsic power consumption is an overhead, preventing their usage in these cases? 
Aiming to answer this question, research over MPPT circuits for low power applications has started.

In order to comprehend some issues behind this intriguing question, a better understanding of the MPPT concept is needed. The MPPT circuits operate by detecting changes on the solar panel, computing the new $V_{MPP}$ and applying this voltage to the photovoltaic module.
Changes in the behavior of the photovoltaic module happen mainly due to variations in temperature and solar irradiance.
Thus, sensors are needed to monitor state changes.
As these sensors imply in extra load in the system, their use in energy-sensitive or low-power systems is often unfeasible.
In order to solve this problem, electronic circuits were developed to extract the solar cell information directly from its electrical characteristics.
Methods as Perturb and Observe~\cite{Piegari:2010,Lapena:PandO}, Incremental Conductance~\cite{Jain:2004,Qin:2011}, Open Circuit Voltage~\cite{Ahmad:2010,Dondi:2008}, Constant Voltage~\cite{Yu:2002} are the most well known.

All the works concerning MPPT methods mentioned above are implemented using printed circuit boards. Although these circuits have proved to be efficient, they could be enhanced by the miniaturization provided by integrated circuits' techniques. This fact has motivated the microelectronic industry to invest in MPPT IC's. The growing popularity of portable devices (e.g. mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, etc.) has provided economic reasons to the  microelectronic industry to release the first MPPT ICs focused on low power devices.
The questions, which are still unanswered, are: Are these MPPT ICs as efficient as the solutions proposed by the academy? If yes, for which range of power consumption are they indicated? The experimental analysis proposed by this work intends to answer these questions.
