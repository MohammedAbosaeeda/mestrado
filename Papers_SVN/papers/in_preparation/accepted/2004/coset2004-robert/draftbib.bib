  ABSTRACT = {Modern high-speed local area net-works offer great
                  potential for communication- intensive applications,
                  but their performance is limited by the use of
                  traditional communication protocols, such as
                  TCP/IP. In most cases, these protocols require that
                  all network access be through the operating system,
                  which adds significant overhead to both the
                  transmission path (typically a system call and data
                  copy) and the receive path (typically an interrupt, a
                  system call, and a data copy). To address this
                  performance problem, several user-level communication
                  architectures have been developed that remove the
                  operating system from the critical communication
                  path. This article describes six important issues to
                  consider in designing communication protocols for
                  user-level architectures. The issues discussed focus
                  on the performance and semantics of a communication
                  system. These issues include data transfer, address
                  translation, protection, and control transfer
                  mechanisms, as well as the issues of reliability and
                  multicast. To provide a basis for analyzing these
                  issues, the authors present a simple network interface
                  protocol for Myricom's Myrinet network, which has a
                  programmable network interface. Researchers can thus
                  explore many protocol design options, and several
                  groups have designed communication systems for
                  Myrinet. In this article, the authors refer to 11 such
                  systems, all of which differ significantly in how they
                  resolve these design issues but all of which aim for
                  high performance and provide a lean, low-level, and
                  more or less generic communication facility.}
