\begin{letter}{ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems \\
    Editor-in-Chief\\
    Prof. Dr. Jörg Henkel}
\opening{Dear Prof. Henkel,}
\setlength{\parskip}{1.5ex}

We would like to submit the attached manuscript,
"Scheduling of energy usage for real-time wireless sensor network systems with the energy-harvesting capability",
for consideration for possible publication in the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems.

The main contributions of the paper are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The use of an energy-aware approach to co-schedule hard real-time tasks and best-effort tasks in a wireless sensor network system with dynamic topology.
	\item The analysis of four heuristics to predict energy production in systems harvesting energy from the environment, and evaluation of the prediction accuracy of these heuristics in photovoltaic systems.
	\item The conception of a simulation approach to assess the effect the proposed heuristics have on system-wide network quality and energy consumption.
	\item The implementation of the proposed approach in an operating system for embedded real-time systems.
\end{itemize}

In respect to a nomination for editor, we are not sure about TECS policy, but Prof. Luca Benini's work on low power embedded systems has a good interface to the manuscript.

Regarding the option of nominating reviewers, the suggestions are:

Mani Srivastava							& Lothar Thiele									& Daniel Mossé \\
University of California, Los Angeles	& Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich & University of Pittsburgh
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\vspace{.5cm}

All three suggested reviewers have a long publication list on either energy-aware scheduling for embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, or energy harvesting for low-power devices.
Also, they have advised a number of students in areas close to that of the manuscript.
The nominees for editor and reviewers have no conflict of interest with the authors of the submitted paper.

This paper has not been published or accepted for publication, and it is not under consideration at any other journal or conference.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
