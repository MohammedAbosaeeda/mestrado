********** bibliography

  Finally, please note that all bibliography entries lack a lot of
  details: name of the conference/journal, volume number, page
  numbers, etc.

Bibliography is incomplete, no conference or journal sources are provided. You must include it in each citation to allow the reader to find cited papers.


********** performance metrics

  Also, a major weakness of the paper is the lack of performance
  figures and comparison with other systems. Without such an
  evaluation, it is hard to evaluate whether the proposed approach is
  valuable or not.


You should add first experimental results of your protocols.


Several of the arguments made in the paper are not substantiated with
empirical data.

Miss first experimental results.

 The paper does not present any
implementation details or quantitative evaluation of the proposed
architecture. 


********** baseline architecture

To make your architecture believable, you definitely need a better description
and motivation of the design decisions as well as a prototype implementation 
to demonstrate its benefits.

- how is the architecture different from other architectures based on Myrinet 
networks?


********** presentation


The first thing that has to be improved in this paper is its presentation:

- the title does not match the content


Incomplete introduction adn bibliography. Paper not focused on the real original work.


This paper should be only focused on lightweigth protocols with myrinet NIC and not be interfered by PPS.

The abstract is too general and too vague and should more adress keypoints and challenges present in the paper.

The introduction is also not really focused on the paper and remains vague on the benefits of clusters.
If EPOS is the purpose of the paper, you must cite it in abstract and introduction.

The detailed description of Myrinet is
superfluous and could
have simply been referenced.

The paper has no related work section that
describes
how this work compliments, extends, or differs from other operating
system research
and development.

Unfortunately, the claims from the abstract and introduction do not match the
actual content of the paper. Most of the paper is a discussion about authors' 
previous work (Epos) and the Myrinet networks in general. 


********** contribution

- clarify what the original contribution is; in section 3.2, it's never
very clear where the general discussion about previous work ends, and
where your contribution begins.

  The main problem with this paper is that the contribution does not
  clearly appear. It mainly stems from the presentation of the
  authors' implementation which lacks too many details about how the
  lightweight communication protocols can be customized by the
  applications, how the overall software architecture is designed,
  etc. Without these details, it is hard to understand how the EPOS
  system better meet the needs of parallel applications than other
  existing communication subsystems.


Clearly fails to present the contribution of the authors: the
description of their environment is not precise enough to get an idea
of what the authors have done. Actually the paper only describes the
Myrinet architecture and the design of existing lightweight protocols
such as BIP...


The paper does not go into sufficient level of detail to understand
what's new and/or
different about EPOS.  

It's never clear
what exactly the original contribution is, and why the proposed idea would
perform better than existing approaches.

********** lightweight protocols

- if this architecture is supposed to support many low-level Myrinet protocols,
you should present at least one or two protocols to illustrate the idea
(this part is just hand-waved in 3.4).


********** other

2.2 : "network hardware does not provide..." : you only speak about NIC and not about network equipments (routers, switchs..).

"many network interfaces are equipped..." : not so many : Myrinet is the most faous ! but what about other choices ? you should cite them (Quadrics...) 





- how about a comparison of Epos with the Pebbles component-based system?




It's very hard to evaluate this paper in terms of technical merit in the 
absence of any implementation and evaluation. Some of the design decisions
seem outrightly wrong. As you mention, the architecture presented in Fig
2 has 4 copy operations for small messages, one more than the minimum
imposed by the Myrinet network. Also, the architecture from Fig 3 should
perform worse than the previous one (one more copy from user to kernel 
and vice-versa for every message).
