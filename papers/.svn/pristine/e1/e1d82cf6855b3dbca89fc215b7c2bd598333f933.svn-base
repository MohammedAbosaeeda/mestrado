                 prevent us from continuing the use of those scaling
                 processes which have served us in the past. It is concluded
                 that the first problem will arise from the storage medium,
                 whose grain size cannot be scaled much below a diameter of
                 ten nanometers without thermal self-erasure. Other problems
                 will involve head-to-disk spacings that approach atomic
                 dimensions, and switching-speed limitations in the head and
                 medium. It is likely that the rate of progress in areal
                 density will decrease substantially as we develop drives
                 with ten to a hundred times current areal densities. Beyond
                 that, the future of magnetic storage technology is unclear.
                 However, there are no alternative technologies which show
                 promise for replacing hard disk storage in the next ten
                 years. "

                  system in which a phase-conjugate object beam is
                  reconstructed by the same reference beam that was used for
                  recording. An intermediate hologram is used as a temporary
                  buffer, recorded with its own reference beam and the
                  data-bearing object beam. Reading this buffer hologram with
                  the phase conjugate of its reference beam reconstructs the
                  phase conjugate of the object beam, which can then be
                  recorded into the desired volume hologram for long-term
                  storage. This method combines the immunity to lens
                  aberrations provided by phase-conjugate readout with the
                  simplicity of using the same multiplexed reference beam for
                  both recording and readout. Only a single pair of
                  phase-conjugate reference beams is required. Experimental
                  results are shown with a single LiNbOolsi :Fe crystal used

                  phase-conjugate mirror in BaTiOolsi that provides the pair

                  conjugate readout, a smart-pixel array, and a linear array of laser

                  this architecture. Our analysis shows that in order for the HRAM to
                  become competitive, the principal tasks will be to reduce spatial light
                  modulator (SLM) and detector pixel sizes to 1 m, increase the output
                  power of compact visible-wavelength lasers to several hundred

        abstract = "With a significant growth of the markets for
                consumer electronics and various embedded systems,
                flash memory is now an economic solution for storage
                systems design. For index structures which require
                inten-sively fine-grained updates/modifications,
                block-oriented access over flash memory could
                introduce a significant number of redundant writes. It
                might not only severely degrade the overall
                performance but also damage the reliability of flash
                memory. In this paper, we propose a very different
                approach which could efficiently handle fine-grained
                updates/modifications caused by B-Tree index access
                over flash memory. The implementation is done directly
                over the flash translation layer (FTL) such that no
                modifications to existing application systems are
                needed. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology
                could significantly improve the system perfor-mance
                and, at the same time, reduce the overheads of
                flash-memory management and the energy dissipation,
                when index structures are adopted over flash memory.",
