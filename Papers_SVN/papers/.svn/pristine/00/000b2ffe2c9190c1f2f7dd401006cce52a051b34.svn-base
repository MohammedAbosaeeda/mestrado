                  power to consumer electronics devices such as
                  smartcards, CD players and pagers. Java is being
                  aggressively targeted at such systems with
                  initiatives such as the Java 2 Platform, Micro
                  Edition, which introduces certain efficiency
                  optimizations to the Java Virtual Machine. Code size
                  reduction has been identified as an important future
                  goal for ensuring Java~s success on embedded systems
                  [20]. However, limited processing power and timing
                  constraints often make traditional compression
                  techniques untenable. An effective solution must
                  meet the conflicting requirements of size reduction
                  and execution performance. We propose modifications
                  to the file format for Java binaries that achieve
                  significant size reduction with little or no
                  performance penalty. Experiments conducted on
                  several large Java class libraries show a typical
                  25% size reduction for class files and a 50% size
                  reduction for JAR files."
