\textbf{Note regarding related works}\\

An early work entitled ``Implementing OS Components in Hardware using AOP'' was published at the
``SIGOPS Operating Systems Review'' (Volume 46 Issue 1, January 2012 ) as an extended version of a
paper entitled ``A Case Study of AOP and OOP applied to digital hardware design'' published at the
proceedings of the ``2011 Brazilian Symposium on Computing System Engineering''. This paper presents
an improved version of the previous proposal and provides significant clarification of the ideas
described in the early revisions.

The previous papers focused on the hardware implementation of an operating system scheduler, while
the current paper introduces two additional case studies extracted from a PABX application and
brings
the previous case study to this same context. With the new case studies we've further generalized
the previous proposal and provided a more comprehensive evaluation. 

Regarding the minimum amount of new material, we have reused in this paper some parts of the
introduction, related work, and body sections of the previous ones. However all figures were
replaced and the section describing the evaluation was completely rewritten to describe the new
case studies and experimental results. We believe that these modifications certainly constitute more
than 30\% of new material compared to the previous works.
