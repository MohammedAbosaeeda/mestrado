                  to many new protocols specifically designed for sensor
                  networks where energy awareness is an essential
                  consideration. Most of the attention, however, has
                  been given to the routing protocols since they might
                  differ depending on the application and network
                  architecture. This paper surveys recent routing
                  protocols for sensor networks and presents a
                  classification for the various approaches pursued. The
                  three main categories explored in this paper are
                  data-centric, hierarchical and location-based. Each
                  routing protocol is described and discussed under the
                  appropriate category. Moreover, protocols using
                  contemporary methodologies such as network flow and
                  quality of service modeling are also discussed. The
                  paper concludes with open research issues.}

                  and which may also make use of actuators or devices
                  with rich computing resources that perform complex
                  signal processing tasks. The use of Bluetooth as the
                  wireless networking technology provides us with a rich
                  palette of Bluetooth-enabled commodity devices, which
                  can be used as actuators, infrastructure gateways, or
                  user interfaces. Our platform consists of a
                  Bluetooth-based sensor node hardware (the BTnode), a
                  portable operating system component, and a set of
                  system services. This paper gives a detailed
                  motivation of our platform and a description of the
                  platform components. Though using Bluetooth in
                  wireless sensor networks may seem counterintuitive at
                  first, we argue that the BTnode platform is indeed
                  well suited for prototyping applications in this
                  domain. As a proof of concept, we describe two

                  enable small but smart sensors to be deployed for a
                  wide range of environmental monitoring
                  applications. In order to constrain communication
                  overhead, dense sensor networks call for new and
                  highly efficient methods for distributing queries to
                  nodes that have observed interesting events in the
                  network. A highly efficient data-centric routing
                  mechanism will offer significant power cost
                  reductions, and improve network longevity. Moreover,
                  because of the large amount of system and data
                  redundancy possible, data becomes disassociated from
                  specific node and resides in regions of the
                  network. This paper describes and evaluates through
                  simulation a scheme we call Rumor Routing, which
                  allows for queries to be delivered to events in the
                  network. Rumor Routing is tunable, and allows for
                  tradeoffs between setup overhead and delivery
                  reliability. It’s intended for contexts in which
                  geographic routing criteria are not applicable because
                  a coordinate system is not available or the phenomenon
                  of interest is not geographically correlated.}

                  energy-efficiency as the main design criterion. This
                  introduces rather conflicting requirements for the
                  hardware adaptation layer. Maximizing the efficiency
                  requires that the presentation must closely mimic the
                  underlying hardware model. On the other hand,
                  increasing the level of abstraction simplifies the
                  development, but at the cost of lowered efficiency
                  because it obstructs the link between the application
                  and the hardware. As new microcontrollers and radios
                  are introduced for use in WSNs, applications must be
                  able to effectively use new low power features and
                  peripherals. The MSP430 family of microcontrollers by
                  Texas Instruments is specifically designed for
                  ultra-low-power applications. It incorporates a 16-Bit
                  RISC CPU, peripherals and a clock system. The
                  MSP430F149 is one of the most popular members of the
                  family. As shown in Fig. 1, it has 60 KB Flash, 2 KB
                  of RAM and a flexible clock system sourced by an
                  internal digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) and/or

  ABSTRACT =	 {In most distributed systems, naming of nodes for
                  low-level communication leverages topological location
                  (such as node addresses) and is independent of any
                  application. In this paper, we investigate an emerging
                  class of distributed systems where low-level
                  communication does not rely on network topological
                  location. Rather, low-level communication is based on
                  attributes that are external to the network topology
                  and relevant to the application. When combined with
                  dense deployment of nodes, this kind of named data
                  enables in-network processing for data aggregation,
                  collaborative signal processing, and similar
                  problems. These approaches are essential for emerging
                  applications such as sensor networks where resources
                  such as bandwidth and energy are limited. This paper
                  is the first description of the software architecture
                  that supports named data and in-network processing in
                  an operational, multi-application sensor-network. We
                  show that approaches such as in-network aggregation
                  and nested queries can significantly affect network
                  traffic. In one experiment aggregation reduces traffic
                  by up to 42\% and nested queries reduce loss rates by
                  30\%. Although aggregation has been previously studied
                  in simulation, this paper demonstrates nested queries
                  as another form of in-network processing, and it
                  presents the first evaluation of these approaches over
                  an operational testbed.}

                  combine the individual devices into an interconnected
                  mesh network where data is seamlessly routed among all
                  the nodes. These networks require no external
                  infrastructure and can scale to hundreds or even
                  thousands of nodes. Here, we explore the standard
                  sensor network platforms where devices range from
                  millimeter-size custom silicon to PDA-size integrated
                  units. Critical to the operation of any sensor network
                  device is the ability to satisfy harsh always-on power
                  requirements. Unlike cell phones and wireless laptops,
                  periodic recharging is not possible for most wireless
                  sensor networks. In many cases, devices are placed in
                  the field for years at a time without maintenance or

                  provide local routing information and synchronicity
                  without global control. Energy savings are achieved by
                  powering down nodes during idle times identified
                  through dynamic scheduling. We present a real
                  implementation on wireless sensor nodes based on a
                  novel, two-level architecture. We evaluate our

                  how the protocol allows adaptive scheduling and
                  enables a smooth trade-off between energy savings and
                  latency. An example current measurement shows an

  ABSTRACT =	 {Composed of tens of thousands of tiny devices with
                  very limited resources (``motes''), sensor networks
                  are subject to novel systems problems and
                  constraints. The large number of motes in a sensor
                  network means that there will often be some failing
                  nodes; networks must be easy to repopulate. Often
                  there is no feasible method to recharge motes, so
                  energy is a precious resource. Once deployed, a
                  network must be reprogrammable although physically
                  unreachable, and this reprogramming can be a
                  significant energy cost. We present Maté, a tiny
                  communication-centric virtual machine designed for
                  sensor networks. Maté's high-level interface allows
                  complex programs to be very short (under 100 bytes),
                  reducing the energy cost of transmitting new
                  programs. Code is broken up into small capsules of 24
                  instructions, which can self-replicate through the
                  network. Packet sending and reception capsules enable
                  the deployment of ad-hoc routing and data aggregation
                  algorithms. Maté's concise, high-level program
                  representation simplifies programming and allows large
                  networks to be frequently reprogrammed in an
                  energy-effcient manner; in addition, its safe
                  execution environment suggests a use of virtual
                  machines to provide the user/kernel boundary on motes
                  that have no hardware protection mechanisms.}

                  economic potential, ability to transform our lives,
                  and pose many new system-building challenges. Sensor
                  networks also pose a number of new conceptual and
                  optimization problems. Some, such as location,
                  deployment, and tracking, are fundamental issues, in
                  that many applications rely on them for needed
                  information. In this paper, we address one of the
                  fundamental problems, namely coverage. Coverage in
                  general, answers the questions about quality of
                  service (surveillance) that can be provided by a
                  particular sensor network. We first define the
                  coverage problem from several points of view including
                  deterministic, statistical, worst and best case, and
                  present examples in each domain. By combining
                  computational geometry and graph theoretic techniques,
                  specifically the Voronoi diagram and graph search
                  algorithms, we establish the main highlight of the
                  paper - optimal polynomial time worst and average case
                  algorithm for coverage calculation. We also present
                  comprehensive experimental results and discuss future
                  research directions related to coverage in sensor
                  networks.}

  ABSTRACT =	 {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are bewming an
                  increasingly important technology that will be used in
                  a variety of applications such as environmental
                  monitoring, infrastructure management, public safety,
                  medical, home and office security, transportation, and
                  militaq. WSNs will also play a key role in pervasive
                  computing where computing devices and people are
                  connected to the Internet. Until now, WSNs and their
                  applications have been developed without considering a
                  management solution. This is a critical problem sincc
                  nctworks comprising tens of thousands of nodes are
                  expected to be used in some of the applications
                  above. This article proposes the MANNA managemcnt
                  architccture for WSNs. In particular, it prescnts the
                  functional, information, and.physical management
                  architectures that take into account specific
                  characteristics of this type of network. Some of them
                  are restrict physical resources such as energy and
                  computing power, frequent reconfiguration and
                  adaptation, and faults caused by nodes
                  unavailable. The MANNA architecture considers three
                  management dimensions: functional areas,
                  management. levels, and WSN functionalities. These
                  dimensions are specified to the management of a WSN
                  and are the basis for a list of management functions,
                  The article also proposes WSN models to guide the
                  management activities and the use of correlation in
                  the WSN management. This is a first step into a
                  largely uncxplored research area.}

  ABSTRACT =	 {Historically, the study of microclimate and habitat
                  utilization have been largely observational, with
                  climatic and behavioral variables being extrapolated
                  from a few or even individual measurement
                  sites. Today, densely deployed sensor networks are
                  being scaled to the size of the organisms under study,
                  ampling phenomena at frequencies the organisms
                  encounter, and dispersed in patterns that capture the
                  full range of environmental exposures to provide the
                  fine-grain information needed for accurate modeling
                  and prediction.},

  ABSTRACT =	 {Wireless sensor networks are networks of compact
                  microsensors with wireless communication
                  capability. These small devices are relatively cheap
                  with the potential to be disseminated in large
                  quantities. Emerging applications of data gathering
                  range from the environmental to the military. As
                  autonomous devices they can provide pervasive
                  distributed and collaborative network of computer
                  nodes. Architectural challenges are posed for
                  designers such as computational power, energy
                  consumption, energy sources, communication channels
                  and sensing capabilities. Embedded Systems provide the
                  computational platform for hardware and software
                  components to interact with the environment and other
                  nodes. This survey presents the current
                  state-of-the-art for wireless sensor nodes,
                  investigating and analyzing these challenges. We
                  discuss the characteristics and requirements for a
                  sensor node mainly processing, communications, power
                  and sensing components. In this survey we present a
                  comprehensive comparative study of sensor nodes
                  platforms, energy management techniques, off-the-shelf
                  microcontrollers, battery types and radio devices.},

  ABSTRACT =	 {We study the problem of media access control in the
                  novel regime of sensor networks, where unique
                  application behavior and tight constraints in
                  computation power, storage, energy resources, and
                  radio technology have shaped this design space to be
                  very different from that found in traditional mobile
                  computing regime. Media access control in sensor
                  networks must not only be energy efficient but should
                  also allow fair bandwidth allocation to the
                  infrastructure for all nodes in a multihop network. We
                  propose an adaptive rate control mechanism aiming to
                  support these two goals and find that such a scheme is
                  most effective in achieving our fairness goal while
                  being energy effcient for both low and high duty cycle
                  of network traffic.},

  ABSTRACT =	 {Sensor networks have the potential to support
                  applications ranging from habitat and structural
                  monitoring, to home and building automation, to supply
                  chain management. Users are typically interested in
                  continuous streams of information representing the
                  evolving status of systems, combined with periodic
                  statistical reports about specific phenomena. Query
                  processing systems, including Directed Diffusion [3],
                  TinyDB [6], and Cougar [10], provide high-level
                  interfaces that allow users to collect and process
                  such continuous streams. They are especially
                  attractive as ways to efficiently implement monitoring
                  applications without forcing users to write complex,
                  low-level code for managing multihop network
                  topologies or for acquiring samples from sensors.},
