\opening{Dear Prof. Pedram,}
\setlength{\parskip}{1.5ex}

I would like to submit the attached manuscript, ``AOP-based RTL HW design using SystemC'', for
consideration for possible publication in the ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic
Systems.

In respect to a nomination for editor, we recommend Prof. Dr. Alex K. Jones due to his expertise in
both digital hardware design and software engineering.

Regarding the option of preferred reviewers, my three nominees are:

\begin{tabular}{p{.30\textwidth} p{.30\textwidth} p{.30\textwidth}}
  Andreas Gerstlauer            & Flávio Wagner                             & Olaf Spinczyk       \\
  University of Texas at Austin & Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul & Technische Universität Dortmund
\end{tabular}

Both Prof. Gerstlauer and Prof. Wagner have a long publication list on digital hardware design
and embedded systems and have advised students in areas close to that of the manuscript. Prof.
Spinczyk is an important researcher in the area of aspect-oriented programming and has also
published works in the same area of the manuscript. The nominees for editor and reviewers have no
conflict of interest with the authors of the paper being submitted.

An early paper describing this work was published at the ``SIGOPS Operating Systems Review'' as an
extended version of a paper published at the proceedings of the ``Brazilian Symposium on Computing
System Engineering''. The paper being submitted presents an improved version of the previous
proposal and provides significant clarification of the ideas described in the early revision.
Furthermore, new additional case studies were implemented in order to provide a more comprehensive
evaluation. These modifications certainly constitute more than 30\% of new material compared to the
previous ones.

Sincerely,

\closing{~}
