The coordinator just receives a certain amount of data and then print the statistics.
The sensor nodes periodically send bursts of 64 bytes to the coordintor and then write the
statistics on the EEPROM
Results are in ms, bytes, bits/s, volts, ampere and joules
The ATMega1281 is clocked at 1 MHz

Obs.: The sensor nodes die if the pkt size = 64. Using pkt size = 32 and multiplying the tx/rx bytes
statistics by two.
Obs.: Due to timing problems, the coordinator always lose 50% of the packets. Dividing the total_tx_packets
statistic by 2 to obtain decent pkt loss ratio.
Obs.: The tx_time is ridiculous, should be divided by 2 also ? YES
