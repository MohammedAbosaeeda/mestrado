                    Basic Rules for Writing Papers at LISHA*


* only to be observed if you ever intend to collaborate with someone
  else; if you do everything by your own, fell free not to follow.

==============================================================================
1 - LaTeX

1.1 - File Organization

Look at Figure "paper_lifecyle.png" for folder name conventions.

In that folder, you can have:
  paper.tex		= your paper
  xxxxx.bib		= bib files for each area associated to the paper
  paper.bst		= the formatted bibliography in case you had to
			  manually adjust bibtex output
  fig			= folder for figures (and tables)
  tab			= folder for tables (if not in fig)
  dat			= folder for experimental data (if not in fig)
  tex			= folder for multi-input papers (larger than 15 pages)
  publisher.cls		= LaTeX classes and style files

ALL the rest should not be committed to the repository! Please, keep
your garbage at your working copy.
 

1.2 - Figures

ALWAYS, EVER, UNCONDITIONALLY use a tool that generates vector graphics.
Raster graphics are likely to cause your paper to be rejected (due to
poor tolerance to resolution adjustments). Best examples are still the
(very) old idraw and xfig. Consider that you might have to repeat the
figures for your slides in case the paper gets accepted and also that
you might need it years later (so do not rely on just-out-of-oven tools,
specially single-developer, free software).

Adjust the size of your figures so that when magnified at 100%, a 10 pt
helvetica type will have the same size as your paper's types (usually 10
pt times roman). You can than shrink it to 75% when exporting, yielding
types around 8 pt (which is the minimum for a 10pt typeset paper). If
after doing so you still get a picture that is much too large for your
paper (quite often for double column styles), rethink your figure! 
Shrinking fonts excessively can also get you a rejected paper.

Be coherent in respect to style. If a figure has borders, then all
figures in your paper should have them. Use the same font and same
shrinking factor for all figures, use same fill patterns (or colors),
and so on.

And never forget: a figure is worth a THOUSAND WORDS!


1.3 - Macros and Common Packages

\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}	% for Latin languages
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}	    % for ISO and UTF characters
\usepackage[english]{babel}     % for multilingual support
\usepackage{graphicx}           % for figures 
\usepackage{subfig}

Some useful macros can be found at util/utils.tex

1.4 - Source Code

Typeset your source code using the "listings" package:

\usepackage{listings}
\lstset{keywordstyle=\bfseries, flexiblecolumns=true}
\lstloadlanguages{C,[ANSI]C++,HTML}
\lstdefinestyle{prg}{
  basicstyle=\small\sffamily,
%  lineskip=-0.2ex, 	% use this in case you're short of space %
  showspaces=false
}
