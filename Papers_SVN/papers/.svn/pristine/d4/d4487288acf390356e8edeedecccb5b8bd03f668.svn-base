The methodology can be explained in more depth and the lack of details makes it difficult to get the whole idea across. The mapping of the example to the methodology can also be dealt in more detail so that the methodology comes across more clearly.

The idea of producing unified description of hardware and software components using AOP and OOP concepts is new and interesting. And the result is clear and strong. The main platform of using Scenario adapter is clear,

However, there are still some missing details:

 1. What is the detailed structure of the Scenario adapter to distinguish the hardware and software?
 2. Is it enough to just consider this two features to make the distinguish? Is additional modification needed before feed to HLS tool?

This paper leverages on aspect-oriented programming concepts to describe system level HW/SW co-design. Hardware and software scenarios are both specified and selected through adaptors. The idea is interesting and the work is solid.

While the principle of AOP is not difficult to understand, the overhead in software and hardware is not as straightforward. Although there are already some description in the paper, a small example will help readers to understand the problem more clearly.
