Title: An application-specific implementation of IEEE802.15.4 MAC for WSN

Abstract:

+ Motivation

Wireless sensor networks are highly dependent on efficient Medium Access
Control (MAC) protocols to make effective use of the few resources
available on traditional motes, bandwidth and energy in particular, but
also memory and processing power. This assertion is confirmed by the
large number of MAC protocol proposals available from the literature. 

+ Problem

Nevertheless, most of the optimizations proposed by specific MAC
protocols focus on specific segments of the design space, so that what
is considered optimization by one class of applications can represent a
strong limitation for others. For instance, a protocol optimized for
massive data dissemination on a firmware update operation (i.e, short,
reliable, low-latency multicast) is certainly not the best choice for
sporadic environment monitoring (i.e, long-lasting, sporadic unicasts).

+ Contribution 

In this article, we implemented and evaluated EPOS C-MAC, a highly
configurable MAC protocol in the scope of EPOS-Mote project. C-MAC works
as a framework of medium access control strategies that can be combined
to produce application-specific protocols. Applications may configure
different communication parameters, such as duty cycle and contention
mechanism. C-MACâ€™s meta-programmed implementation yields smaller 
footprint and higher performance than equivalent protocols for wireless 
sensor networks. The EPOS-Mote devices used in this work feature a 
IEEE802.15.4 compliant radio, which enabled us to evaluate additional 
configuration parameters, such as beaconing and forward error
correction.

1. Introduction
+ Why is MAC important
- make effective use of resources

+ There are many MAC proposals
- each one with specifc optimization for one class of applications
- applications have different requirements

+ There is no optmal MAC for all applications
- existing MAC protocols do not provide adequate configuration mechanism

+ C-MAC
- framework of medium access control strategies
- applications may configure differet communication protocols
- meta-programmed implementation yields smaller footprint and higher performance

+ Paper goal
- throught the formalization of the main categories of MACs we were able to improve C-MAC giving it a greater level of configuration
- the implementation of IEEE802.15.4 MAC throught C-MAC
- evaluation of novel configuration parameters, including network beaconing

2. MAC protocols for WSN
+ MAC main characteristcs
- tradeoffs latency, throughput and reliabilty for energy efficiency
- main sources of energy consumption:
* idle listening
* collisions
* overhearing
* traffic fluctuations

+ MAC categories 
- channel polling (B-MAC, X-MAC), state machine
- scheduled contention (S-MAC, T-MAC), state machine
- time division multiple access (Sohrabi and Pottie), state machine
- hybrid (Z-MAC)

+ S-MAC
- description
- T-MAC (improvement of S-MAC - adaptative duty cycle)

+ B-MAC
- description
- X-MAC (improvement of B-MAC - reduces overhearing, piggybacks address information into its preamble)

+ 802.15.4
- description

3. C-MAC framework
+ C-MAC is a configurable MAC protocol for WSN
- EPOS is a component based framework, based on the ADESD methodology
* small memory footprint and high performance achived through static metaprogramming and function inlining
- configurable characteristics are define by configurable traits in EPOS (avoid this)

+ Extension of the prior version and now have these main configuration points
- basic communication characteristics
- duty cycle and organization ->sync
- collision-avoidance mechanism
- collision-detection mechanism
- collision-handling mechanism

+ IEEE802.15.4 characteristics introduced in C-MAC
- new configuration points inside "duty cycle and organization"
* network beaconing organization
