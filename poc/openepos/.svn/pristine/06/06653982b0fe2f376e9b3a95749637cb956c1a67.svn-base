/*! @class System::Spin
    @ingroup utils

    @brief The Spin lock is a synchronization mechanism for multi-processor architectures. While more costly than a normal mutex lock, it maintains consistency if two threads running on two separate processors try to acquire the lock concurrently.

    @note The current implementation is known to not work on SMP systems.

    <!-- *********************************************************************** -->

    @fn void System::Spin::acquire()
	@brief Acquires the spin lock.

    <!-- *********************************************************************** -->

    @fn void System::Spin::release()
	@brief Releases the spin lock.
