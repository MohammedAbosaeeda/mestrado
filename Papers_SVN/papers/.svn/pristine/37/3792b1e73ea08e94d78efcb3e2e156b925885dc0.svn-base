  abstract =	"Aspect oriented programming aims at achieving better
		 modularization for a system's crosscutting concerns in
		 order to improve its key quality attributes, such as
		 evolvability and reusability. Consequently, the
		 adoption of aspect-oriented techniques in existing
		 (legacy) software systems is of interest to remediate
		 software aging. The refactoring of existing systems to
		 employ aspect-orientation will be considerably eased by
		 a systematic approach that will ensure a safe and
		 consistent migration. In this paper, we propose a
		 refactoring and testing strategy that supports such an
		 approach and consider issues of behavior conservation
		 and (incremental) integration of the aspect-oriented
		 solution with the original system. The strategy is
		 applied to the JHotDraw open source project and
		 illustrated on a group of selected concerns. Finally,
		 we abstract from the case study and present a number of
		 generic refactorings which contribute to an incremental
		 aspect-oriented refactoring process and associate
		 particular types of crosscutting concerns to the model
		 and features of the employed aspect language. The
		 contributions of this paper are both in the area of
		 supporting migration towards aspect-oriented solutions
		 and supporting the development of aspect languages that
		 are better suited for such migrations.",
