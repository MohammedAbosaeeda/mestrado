				Abstract

As commodity microprocessors and networks reach performance levels comparable to
 those used in massively parallel processors, clusters of symmetric multiprocess
ors are starting to be called the supercomputers of tomorrow. At the low-end of 
this technology are the clusters of SMP PCs, usually based on Pentium Pro or Pen
tium II processors. Many groups in the academia and in the industry are setting 
up such clusters with big expectations. However, how far can one go with a clust
er of SMP PCs when the goal is high performance computing?
 
        This paper discusses several aspects regarding the adoption of clusters 
of SMP PCs to support high performance computing, including software and hardwar
e restrains to deliver processing power to parallel applications, as well as the
 most innovative alternatives to overcome these restrains. Besides discussing th
e current state of PC cluster computing, the authors identify further enhancemen
ts that will help to enable these low-cost machines to join the HPC universe.
