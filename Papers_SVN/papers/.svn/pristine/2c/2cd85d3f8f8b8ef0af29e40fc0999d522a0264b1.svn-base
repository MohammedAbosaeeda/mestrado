\section{Conclusion} \label{concl}

%Energy constraints are among the most critical limitations on designing wireless sensor network systems. 
%Solar energy harvesting techniques have emerged along last decades aiming to contribute for solving this problem.
%In this context, MPPT circuits have been designed to improve energy harvesting efficiency.
%However, only a few of them were designed for recent low power wireless platforms.
%With the widespread use of portable electronic devices, the integrated circuit industry has been recently released some MPPT integrated circuits.

Although MPPT integrated circuits are efficient for a variety of electronic devices, this work leads to the conclusion that there is still a gap on the MPPT solutions proposed by the integrated circuit industry.
Through experimental analysis, this work has shown that, for low power wireless platforms, even one of the most suitable MPPT IC available in the market does not overcome the circuit directly connecting the solar panel with the batteries.
Two experiments carried under different environmental conditions have shown that, at no time, the MPPT IC was more efficient than the directly coupled circuit.
Finally, this paper motivates future works aiming to develop MPPT energy harvesting circuits dedicated for low power sensor platforms. A discussion over MPPT efficiency is presented where a software/hardware MPPT technique is suggested.
