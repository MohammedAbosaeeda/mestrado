  ABSTRACT = {Wireless sensor networks are composed of large
                  numbers of tiny networked devices that communicate
                  untethered. For large scale networks it is important
                  to be able to dynamically download code into the
                  network. In this paper we present Contiki, a
                  lightweight operating system with support for
                  dynamic loading and replacement of individual
                  programs and services. Contiki is built around an
                  event-driven kernel but provides optional preemptive
                  multithreading that can be applied to individual
                  processes. We show that dynamic loading and
                  unloading is feasible in a resource constrained
                  environment, while keeping the base system
                  lightweight and compact.},

                  experimentation. Telos is the latest in a line of
                  motes developed by UC Berkeley to enable wireless
                  sensor network (WSN) research. It is a new mote
                  design built from scratch based on experiences with
                  previous mote generations. Telos?new design consists
                  of three major goals to enable experimentation:
                  minimal power consumption, easy to use, and
                  increased software and hardware robustness. We
                  discuss how hardware components are selected and
                  integrated in order to achieve these goals. Using a
                  Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller, Chipcon
                  IEEE 802.15.4-compliant radio, and USB, Telos's
                  power profile is almost one-tenth the consumption of
                  previous mote platforms while providing greater
                  performance and throughput. It eliminates
                  programming and support boards, while enabling
                  experimentation with WSNs in both lab, testbed, and
                  deployment settings.}
