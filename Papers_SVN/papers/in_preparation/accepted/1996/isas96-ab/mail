Dear Prof. Frohlich:

I am sorry we sent you a submission confirmation for one of your the two
papers you sent us. If you sent both of them together we shuld have the
second one. In such a case my secretary may have cliped together both of them
and I did not notice it. I am sorry about it. I cannot have a definitive
answer right now about what happened, because I am on an Eastern-trip, and my
secretary is on her Eatern-vacation. Next monday we will send you the
required information. I hope we did not disturbed you very much.

Dear Prof. Frolich:

Your paper contribution to ISAS 95 was an important ingredient to the
success of the Focus Symposium and a significant factor to the award
received by ISAS 95 as the best Focus Sumposium quality.  The award
was confered by the System Research Foundation (Canada), organization
that decided to co-sponsor ISAS 96 to be held at Orlando, on July
22-26, 1996.  Thank you for your contribution and for participating in
this successful event.

We invite you to continue with a similar contribution for ISAS 96.  I
am sending you a Call for Papers for ISAS 96.  On the name of the
organizing committee we also ask you to consider the possibility of
organizing an invited session for ISAS 96.  In such a case the steps
we suggest are the following:

To organize an invited session for ISAS 96, the following steps are
suggested:

1) Identify a special topic which is on the scope of ISAS 96.  You man
contact me or other program committee members on its suitability.

2) Contact researches or practitioners in your field to see if they
can contribute a paper to your proposed session and attend ISAS 96.

3) Collect the abstracts (2-3 pages) from each perspective invitee.

4) Write a summary (1-2 page) on the session4s significance and
coherence of the invited/selected papers.

5) Mail the invited session proposal including a summary and a copy of
all abstracts by January 19, 1996 to me:

		ISAS 96

The success achieved in ISAS 95, held in Baden-Baden (Germany) and awarded by the International Institute for Advanced Studies in Systems Research and Cybernetics (Canada), as the best and largest Symposium in the 5th International Conference on Systems Research, Informatics and Cybernetics, encouraged its sponsors and session chairs to organize a similar meeting on July 22-26 at Orlando.  

	ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS

As in ISAS 95, an electronic version of the ISAS 96 proceedings will also be available in diskettes or in CD-ROM, with search and hypertext features. Other media,such as sound, animation, video, are also being considered.

	  INCLUSION OF ISAS 96
 	PROCEEDINGS IN A CD-ROM 
	 EXTENDED ENCYCLOPEDIA

These proceedings will be included in the CD-ROM Extended Encyclopedia of Systemics, Informatics and Cybernetics (TM), whose development is presently in progress.


    PARTICIPATIVE DESIGN FOR EARLY AUTHORS

Authors of early submitted and accepted papers will have the opportunity to make suggestions about new requirements that are not being fullfiled by ISAS 95 software, which was a first prototype. In this way they could engage in the evolutive participative design that is being followed for both  the Electronic Proceedings and the CD-ROM Extended Encyclopedia. 

	 PUBLICATIONS

Participants who wish to present a paper are requested to submit three copies of an extended abstract or condensed first draft (500-1500 words) by March 25, 1996. All submitted papers will be referred. ISAS 96 papers will be published by means of paper and electronic proceedings. Selected papers will be published by the International Institute of Informatics and Systemics and included in the CD-ROM Extended Encyclopedia of Systemics, Informatics and Cybernetics (TM), whose development is presently in progress. Notification of acceptance will be sent to authors by April 29, 1996. The full paper cannot exceed 8 single-spaced typed pages with photoready copies of artwork that should be submitted by May 31, 1996.

ABSTRACT


The abstract should summarize the content of the paper.  Try to keep the abstract below 200 words.  Do not have references or displayed equations in the abstract.  The conference Proceedings will be printed by photooffset from the same-sized copy prepared by you.  Your manuscript should be printed on 8.5" x 11", or (A4) paper, using a high quality laser printer.  It is imperative that the margins and style described below be adhered to carefully.  This will enable us to maintain uniformity in the final printed copies of the Proceedings.  Please keep in mind that the manuscript you prepare will be photographed and printed as it is received.  Readibility of copy is of paramount importance.

Keywords: Author Guide, Manuscript, Camera-Ready Format, Instructions for Authors, Paper Specifications.

1.	IMPORTANT  INFORMATION

There is a limit of 8 pages for each paper in the Proceedings.  At most 2 additional pages can be included, provided the fee of  US$ 100.00 per extra page is submitted with the Author´s registration form. Be sure to fill out and send with yours camera-ready manuscript IIIS Copyright form,  your registration forms and Payments.

The deadline for receipt of your Camera-ready manuscript, IIIS Copyright form registration and payments is May 31, 1996.  The address is:



Nagib Callaos
Dpto. de Procesos y Sistemas
Universidad Simón Bolívar
A.P. 89000
Caracas, Venezuela

2.	PREPARATION OF MANUSCRIPTS

General Appearance

The text must be in English. The submitted typeset scripts of each contribution must be in their final form and of good appearance because they will be printed directly without any editing. It is essential that the "camera-ready copies" be absolutely clean and unfolded. The copy should be evenly printed on a high quality (300 dots/inch or higher) laser printer.  There should not be corrections made on the printed pages.  Ensure that adhesive tape does not cover any typeset letterings.  Your paper must be printed actual size (exactly how it is to appear in the Proceedings) in two colums. 

Specifications:

As part of the printing process your document will be photographed.  To ensure that this can be done with one camera setting for all papers and to ensure uniformity of appearance for the Proceedings, your paper should conform to the following specifications. If your paper deviates significantly from these specifications, the printer may not be able to include your paper in the Proceedings.


1) On the first page, the distance from the top edge of the paper to the top of the first line of type (the title) should be 2.0 cm.
2) On the second and subsequent pages, the distance from the top edge of the paper to the top pf the first line of type should be 1.5 cm.
3) The text should be centered left-to-right on the page (left and right margins should be the same).
4) The windth of each column should be 8.1 cm.
5) The distance between the two columns of text should be 1.5 cm.
6) The distance from the top edge of the paper to the bottom of the last line of type on the page should be no more than 25.4 cm.  This allows for the printer to insert page numbers.
7) Lightly number each page at the bottom using a soft pencil (not ink) e.g. 1/8, 2/6...6/8.


3.	RECOMMENDED POINT SIZES

On 8.5" x 11" (or A4) paper, we recommend a font of 9 points or greater.  This document is set in 9 point Times.  If absolutely necessary, we suggest the use of condensed line spacing rather than smaller point sizes. This section is condensed to 80% or normal line spacing.  Some technical formatting programs print mathematical formulas in italic type, with subscripts and superscripts in a slightly smaller font size.  This is acceptable.


4.	Headings

Major headings are to be column centered in a bold font or in capitals without underline.  They may be numbered, if so desired. "4. HEADINGS" at the top of this paragraph is a major heading.

Subheadings

Subheadings should be in a bold font or underlined lower case with initial capitals.  They should start at the left-hand margin on a separate line.

		Sub-subheadings:  Sub-subheadings are to be in a bold font or underlined type. They should be indented and run in at the beginning of the paragraph.  The top of this paragragh illustrates a sub-subheading.

		Title:  The title should be centered across the top of the first page and should be in a distinctive point size or font.

		Authors Names and Addresses:  The authors names and addresses should be centered below the title.  These lines should be in at least eleven point type, but the particular point sizes and fonts are not critical and are left to the discretion of the authors.

		


		Keywords:   From 5 to 7 keywords should follow the abstract (as a subheading of the Abstract).

		References:  List and number all references at the end of the paper.  When citing references in the text, type the corresponding number in square brackets as shown at the end of this sentence (1).  No type should appear below the footnote.

		Ilustrations:  All halftone illustrations (pictures) should be clear black and white prints.  Do not supply Xerox copies. These illustrations should be furnished positioned within the copy, or placed at the end of the paper.  Make sure that you include a caption for each photograph or line drawing. For best reproduction of line drawings, we prefer the original black on white drawings pasted in position within the copy on the layout paper or at the end of the paper.  Do not use poor photostats, ozalids, blueprints, hectos, Xerox, etc.  for the drawings, illustrations or charts, since shades of blue, green and brown do not photograph successfully.

 
5. FORMULAE

All equations must be typed or written neatly in black. They should be numbered consecutively throughout the text. Equation numbers should be enclosed in parentheses and flushed right. Equations should be referred to as Eq. (X) in the text where X is the equation number. In multiple-line equations, the number should be given on the last line.


6. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Acknowledgements should follow the text just before the references.


7. FOOTNOTES

Should be typed in singled-line spacing at the bottom of the page and column where it is cited.  Footnotes should be rare.


8. CONCLUSIONS

The better you look, the better we all look.  Thanks for your cooperation and contribution.  We look forward to seeing you at ISAS ´96  in Orlando, Florida.


9. REFERENCES

The following is an example of the recommended style for references.

2.	PREPARATION OF MANUSCRIPTS

General Appearance

The text must be in English. The submitted typeset scripts of each contribution must be in their final form and of good appearance because they will be printed directly without any editing. It is essential that the "camera-ready copies" be absolutely clean and unfolded. The copy should be evenly printed on a high quality (300 dots/inch or higher) laser printer.  There should not be corrections made on the printed pages.  Ensure that adhesive tape does not cover any typeset letterings.  Your paper must be printed actual size (exactly how it is to appear in the Proceedings) in two colums. 

Specifications:

As part of the printing process your document will be photographed.  To ensure that this can be done with one camera setting for all papers and to ensure uniformity of appearance for the Proceedings, your paper should conform to the following specifications. If your paper deviates significantly from these specifications, the printer may not be able to include your paper in the Proceedings.


1) On the first page, the distance from the top edge of the paper to the top of the first line of type (the title) should be 2.0 cm.
2) On the second and subsequent pages, the distance from the top edge of the paper to the top pf the first line of type should be 1.5 cm.
3) The text should be centered left-to-right on the page (left and right margins should be the same).
4) The windth of each column should be 8.1 cm.
5) The distance between the two columns of text should be 1.5 cm.
6) The distance from the top edge of the paper to the bottom of the last line of type on the page should be no more than 25.4 cm.  This allows for the printer to insert page numbers.
7) Lightly number each page at the bottom using a soft pencil (not ink) e.g. 1/8, 2/6...6/8.


3.	RECOMMENDED POINT SIZES

On 8.5" x 11" (or A4) paper, we recommend a font of 9 points or greater.  This document is set in 9 point Times.  If absolutely necessary, we suggest the use of condensed line spacing rather than smaller point sizes. This section is condensed to 80% or normal line spacing.  Some technical formatting programs print mathematical formulas in italic type, with subscripts and superscripts in a slightly smaller font size.  This is acceptable.


4.	Headings

Major headings are to be column centered in a bold font or in capitals without underline.  They may be numbered, if so desired. "4. HEADINGS" at the top of this paragraph is a major heading.

Subheadings

Subheadings should be in a bold font or underlined lower case with initial capitals.  They should start at the left-hand margin on a separate line.

		Sub-subheadings:  Sub-subheadings are to be in a bold font or underlined type. They should be indented and run in at the beginning of the paragraph.  The top of this paragragh illustrates a sub-subheading.

		Title:  The title should be centered across the top of the first page and should be in a distinctive point size or font.

		Authors Names and Addresses:  The authors names and addresses should be centered below the title.  These lines should be in at least eleven point type, but the particular point sizes and fonts are not critical and are left to the discretion of the authors.

		


		Keywords:   From 5 to 7 keywords should follow the abstract (as a subheading of the Abstract).

		References:  List and number all references at the end of the paper.  When citing references in the text, type the corresponding number in square brackets as shown at the end of this sentence (1).  No type should appear below the footnote.

		Ilustrations:  All halftone illustrations (pictures) should be clear black and white prints.  Do not supply Xerox copies. These illustrations should be furnished positioned within the copy, or placed at the end of the paper.  Make sure that you include a caption for each photograph or line drawing. For best reproduction of line drawings, we prefer the original black on white drawings pasted in position within the copy on the layout paper or at the end of the paper.  Do not use poor photostats, ozalids, blueprints, hectos, Xerox, etc.  for the drawings, illustrations or charts, since shades of blue, green and brown do not photograph successfully.

 
5. FORMULAE

All equations must be typed or written neatly in black. They should be numbered consecutively throughout the text. Equation numbers should be enclosed in parentheses and flushed right. Equations should be referred to as Eq. (X) in the text where X is the equation number. In multiple-line equations, the number should be given on the last line.


6. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Acknowledgements should follow the text just before the references.


7. FOOTNOTES

Should be typed in singled-line spacing at the bottom of the page and column where it is cited.  Footnotes should be rare.


8. CONCLUSIONS

The better you look, the better we all look.  Thanks for your cooperation and contribution.  We look forward to seeing you at ISAS ´96  in Orlando, Florida.

Dear Professor Callaos,

	I just received your mail with the instructions, acceptance
letter, copyright form and registration form. The final version is already 
being prepared.

	However, I notice that there is no credit card option for the
registration, and, as you may remember from last year in Baden-Baden, we
have serious troubles the send money abroad in Brazil. 

	Is there any option to pay the registration by credit card?

	Tank you,
