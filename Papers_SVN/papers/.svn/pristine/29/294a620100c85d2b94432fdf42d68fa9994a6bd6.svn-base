Dear  Prof. Frohlich:

Thank you for answering to our invitation.  Distributed Systems are in
tune with ISAS 95, specially if we are talking about Distribuited
Information Systems or Distributed Databases.  WWW is also a very
welcomed area.  We will have a significant group of Latinoamerican
participants, which will be -I think- very interested, on knowing
about the first server of Latin America.  So, any of both papers will
be of a high interest for us.  How about both of them?


The deadline is the same for the papers.  We will extend the deadline
for the abstracts in your case.


Best regards,




Nagib Callaos

Dear Prof. Nagib Callaos,

	First of all, we want to thank you for the invitation to present a paper in the 5th International Symposium on Systems Research, Informatics and Cybernetics. Second we would like to express our happyness to have our works recognaized. (I'm also writing in the name of Prof. Elizabeth S. Specialski and Prof. Jose Eduardo De Lucca).

	Now, I'd like to solve some doubts. I couldn't realize the exact area where I'm expected to act. My major is Distributed Systems, but I'm not sure it's a subject concerning ISAS'95 interests. Is it? The folder talks about ISAS'95 as been part of a larger event InterSymp'95. There would be a more appropriate part to present a paper on Distributed Systems?

	If you think Distributed Systems aren't tuned to the conference, I could drive my paper through a second area, describing our experience in handling the first WWW server of the Latin America. Possibly, this case study on Information Systems would be more useful to the conference. I hope you can help me to clarify this point.

	At last, in the folder, you point the 5th of March as the deadline for the abstracts. We only received your invitation today. May we consider the date of May 5 as our deadline?

	Sincerely yours,

		Antonio Augusto Frohlich

                 A Name Server for Distributed Environments

		T. B. Corso, A. A. Frohlich and L. F. Fausto
	
				Abstract

	This paper describes a new versatile name server for distributed
environments, which maps object names (independently of its location) into
identifiers. This server dynamicly supports global or local name spaces,
according to system requirements. The server incorporates an authentication
engine that, after checking a request, suply the client with an authentication
key. Such key can be adopted by other servers as an security criteria for
further communications with clients.

	At this time, an operating version of the server is available. This
version acts as the file name server for the Pyxis distributed file system,
which uses the server authentication capability to validate requests to all
other component servers. In that environment, the name server is in charge of
supporting a distributed hierarchic naming space visible to the users like a
directory tree.
