  ABSTRACT = {We have found many programming problems for which
                  neither procedural nor object-oriented programming
                  techniques are sufficient to clearly capture some of
                  the important design decisions the program must
                  implement. This forces the implementation of those
                  design decisions to be scattered through-out the code,
                  resulting in 'tangled' code that is excessively
                  difficult to develop and maintain. We present an
                  analysis of why certain design decisions have been so
                  difficult to clearly capture in actual code. We call
                  the properties these decisions address aspects, and
                  show that the reason they have been hard to capture is
                  that they cross-cut the system's basic
                  functionality. We present the basis for a new
                  programming technique, called aspect-oriented
                  programming, that makes it possible to clearly express
                  programs involving such aspects, including appropriate
                  isolation, composition and re-use of the aspect
                  code. The discussion is rooted in systems we have
                  built using aspect-oriented programming.}

  ABSTRACT = {A class of practical fast algorithms is introduced for the discrete cosine transform (DCT). For an 8-point DCT only 11 multiplications and 29 additions are required. A systematic approach is presented for generating the different members in this class, all having the same minimum arithmetic complexity. The structure of many of the published algorithms can be found in members of this class. An extension of the algorithm to longer transformations is presented. The resulting 16-point DCT requires only 31 multiplications and 81 additions, which is, to the authors' knowledge, less than required by previously published algorithms}

    ABSTRACT = {Summary form only given. In this presentation we will cover the bottom-up and top-down approaches to IP-based design technology in the semiconductor industry and explain the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. We will start with requirements for IP-based design, explain the obstacles to success for IP community, and identify problems to be solved to remove those obstacles. We will review briefly the present status and make some prediction for the future in conclusion}
